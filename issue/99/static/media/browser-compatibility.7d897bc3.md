# Browser compatibility

With Porsche UI Kit we secure the visual and functional compatibility without any code optimisation of all contents for a defined set of browsers and versions. The supported set is defined and updated based on a quarterly usage analysis. To consider local differences in our greatest markets the possible deviation of China, USA, Germany is determined.

All browser versions that have less than 1% share of the total sessions do not need to be supported anymore. 
The current usage analysis can be found in the [Browser Usage Dashboard](https://datastudio.google.com/open/1kMBbEg9F79q_QOg2zFtz52I_S85Fy47b)
