# Start Designing

The Porsche UI Kit enables designers to create outstanding digital designs by using the prebuild libraries, styles and templates - fast and qualitative. 

## Sketch Library
The components of the Porsche UI Kit are provided in two Sketch libraries that can be easily linked with Sketch by clicking on the following RSS library links. Once linked, Sketch will automatically check for updates. 
Please be aware of the library version in use (Sketch: Preferences → Libraries) and align with your developer counterpart on the used version.

### Basic Library
The basic library contains the fundamental elements that can be used both individually and within the components, such as typography, colors or spacings.

### Web and App Library
The web library provides components that are to be used within web applications, like buttons, form elements and many more.

### App Library
The App Library is containing specific components for native apps.

## Sketch Template
To get a smooth and easy "designing from scratch" experience, you are welcome to use the following Sketch layout template. It contains artboards in all relevant screen sizes and is enriched with the right layout and grid presets (that can be turned visible via: View → Canvas → Show Layout.). 
[Download Sketch Layout Template](http://ui.porsche.com/latest/porsche-ui-kit-layout-template.sketch)!


## Sketch Plugins
Some of the components provide a smooth layout behaviour (such as automatic resizing on content input). To get the most out of it, please install the Sketch plugin [Anima](https://www.animaapp.com/).  
A curated list of more plugins that are recommended (yet not obligatory) for a smooth Sketch workflow can be found [here](#/getting-started/sketch-plugins).

## Typeface

You can download the Porsche font files in the Porsche Brand Guide:  
[Download Porsche typeface](https://brandguide.porsche.com/elements/manual/view/id/885)  
For UI design use within Sketch, we recommend using the "Typefaces for digital users, Web Developer Kit". 

## Design Workflow
To improve the output efficiency and reduce maintenance cost we decided on using the tools [Sketch](https://www.sketch.com/) and [Abstract](https://www.goabstract.com/how-it-works/). 

So, before starting designing with the Sketch library, make sure to [request a Porsche UI Abstract Seat](http://eepurl.com/gnOIXD) to access and work within the Porsche UI organisation and to install the latest [Abstract Desktop App](https://app.goabstract.com/)
