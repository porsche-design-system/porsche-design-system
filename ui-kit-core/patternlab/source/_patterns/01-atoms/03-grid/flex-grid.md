# @Experimental
It's possible to overwrite any parent or children flex modifier on every defined breakpoint on markup level by adding corresponding breakpoint suffix to modifier class.

Anyway it's recommended (whenever possible) to use corresponding flex mixins within a new css component scoped and abstracted by it's namespace for better maintainability.
