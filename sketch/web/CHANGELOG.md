# v1 to v2

## Introduction

We recommend upgrading to v2.
This guide includes everything you need to migrate your offering.

## Why you should migrate?

**Adjustments**

- Porsche Next Font with new metrics
- Surface color for dark theme regarding accessibility criteria
- Hover/Active color for dark theme regarding accessibility criteria
- Focus state for light and dark theme
- Neutral color low for light theme
- Validation Forms

**New**

- Select Combobox
- Select for dark theme
- Banner Notification
- Modal
- Notification soft colors for dark theme
- Tabs and Tabs Bar

## Download Sketch Libraries

Head over to [Start Designing](https://designsystem.porsche.com/v2/start-designing/introduction) to set up the new Sketch libraries.

## Design migration strategy

The transition cause a major break in the UI.

Ask yourself during the entire visual review and iteration process

- Are you using the new Porsche Next?
- Are you using the color styles correctly?
- Is the spacing between components correct?
- Does the general layout still work?

### Please note

Upgrading to the v2 Library will not automatically change any component created in previous version of the Library. For some Components with Text (like Buttons) you have to “Shrink the element to fit the content” in Overrides and if you have
line-breaks you can set the “auto-size” Alignment.

We don’t recommend a piece-by-piece migration of your product in production. Teams should perform the migration first in a separate branch (or branches). This allows the creation of new design specs for any possible rough spots in alignment or sizing that may appear in the UI after upgrading.

Meet with stakeholders from design, OM, and engineering to kick off the migration process.

The font for Porsche remains Porsche Next. The font metrics was redesigned for better clarity and legibility. Work with your development team to discuss how this new metrics might affect your team’s workflow.
