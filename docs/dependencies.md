## Overview of Framework Versions

|         | Monorepo | Sample Integrations    |
| ------- |----------| ---------------------- |
| Angular | 15.2.10  | 16.2.3                 |

## Vue

All Vue related dependencies can't be updated at the moment because `vue-property-decorator` and `vue-class-component`
aren't Vue **3** compatible. In addition `sass-loader` can't be updated because it needs at least Webpack 5 but Vue **
2** uses Webpack 4 under the hood. `vmark` and `vmark-loader` can't be updated since those packages are incompatible
with Vue **2** and **3**.

### Affected dependencies:

- `vue`
- `vue-router`
- `vue-template-compiler`
- `vuex`
- `@vue/cli-plugin-babel`
- `@vue/cli-plugin-router`
- `@vue/cli-plugin-typescript`
- `@vue/cli-plugin-unit-jest`
- `@vue/cli-plugin-vuex`
- `@vue/cli-service`
- `@vue/test-utils`
- `sass-loader`
- `vmark`
- `vmark-loader`
- `@stackblitz/sdk` uses optional chaining internally which can't be handled by webpack 4 without additional babel
  plugins

## Angular

Angular CLI decides by itself which TypeScript version it supports. As soon as an unsupported TypeScript version is
installed, the Angular build will fail.

As mentioned here https://angular.io/guide/creating-libraries#ensuring-library-version-compatibility, if building
component-libraries, the Angular version used to build an application should always be the same or greater than the
Angular versions used to build any of its dependent libraries.

We are now on `Angular v15` after conformation of our consuming teams. Before upgrading to a new version, ensure all
consuming teams are already on the next major.

### Affected dependencies:

- `typescript`
- `@angular/animations`
- `@angular/common`
- `@angular/compiler`
- `@angular/core`
- `@angular/forms`
- `@angular/platform-browser`
- `@angular/platform-browser-dynamic`
- `@angular/router`
- `@angular-builders/custom-webpack`
- `@angular-devkit/build-angular`
- `@angular/cli`
- `@angular/compiler-cli`
- `@angular/language-service`
- `ng-packagr`
- `angular-imask` with v7.0.0 it is bundled for Angular 16 and became incompatible with our Angular 15 setup:

## Styled Components

With v6 they are providing their own types and thereby replace `@types/styled-components` but with tons of issues
especially around style objects that we provide. This seems to be the main issue covering all typing related problems:
https://github.com/styled-components/styled-components/issues/4062  
Those issues were not resolved in `6.0.7`, yet.

### Affected dependencies:

- `styled-components`

## Globby

`globby` decided to provide just a modern _ESM_ build with their latest npm package. Unfortunately there's no stable way
of using it with Node or TS-Node.

- [ESM support: soliciting feedback](https://github.com/TypeStrong/ts-node/issues/1007)

### Affected dependencies:

- `globby`

## Change Case

Since v5.0.0 `change-case` decided to provide just a modern _ESM_ build with their latest npm package. Unfortunately there's
no stable way of using it with Node or TS-Node.

### Affected dependencies:

- `change-case`
