# Dependencies

## Dependency updates

Every week, we update our NPM packages:

1. Switch to **project root directory**
2. Run `yarn upgrade-interactive --latest`  
   This should output the dependencies you might want to update. Select the NPM dependencies to be updated and press _
   Enter_. Afterwards execute automated tests to make sure application still works.
3. Angular has to be updated with `ng update`.
4. `cd packages/components-angular`
5. `./node_modules/.bin/ng update`
6. `./node_modules/.bin/ng update @angular/cli @angular/core`
7. Check `MAX_TS_VERSION` in `packages/components-angular/node_modules/@angular/compiler-cli/src/typescript_support.js`
   which indicates whether `typescript` can be updated for Angular packages or not.
8. `exit` to leave the docker container
9. Run `yarn`

### Hints for updating

1. Make sure you pulled the latest version before starting.
2. To avoid corrupting the `yarn.lock` start with Angular (by using `ng update`). The following upgrades should be
   grouped e.g. if React types can be upgraded also look if React can be upgraded.
3. Don't upgrade too many dependencies at once, keep them logically together.
4. Certain dependencies can not be upgraded which are documented in `docs/dependencies.md`
5. In case you discover new dependencies that can not be upgraded, e.g. due to esm builds not compatible with nodejs,
   add them to the list
6. Update `docs/dependencies.md` to reflect the current date and adjust framework versions if needed
7. Once you updated everything possible, delete `yarn.lock` and have it created again by running `yarn` in order to
   update dependencies of our dependencies

We are using Dependabot to manage our dependencies. Every note about not updatable dependencies in this document is also
reflected in the configuration file under `.github/dependabot.yml` and must be kept in sync!

## Overview of Framework Versions

|         | Monorepo | Sample Integrations   |
| ------- | -------- | --------------------- |
| Angular | 20.3.5   | 20.0.5                |

## Jest & JSDom

Causing lots of problems with the `jsdom-polyfill` package.

- `jest`
- `jest-environment-jsdom`
- `jsdom`
- `@types/jest`

## Globby (components-angular/components-manager-cli)

`globby` decided to provide just a modern _ESM_ build with their latest npm package. Unfortunately there's no stable way
of using it with Jest / Angular Karma.

- [Pure ESM package](https://gist.github.com/sindresorhus/a39789f98801d908bbc7ff3ecc99d99c#how-can-i-make-my-typescript-project-output-esm)
- [ESM support: soliciting feedback](https://github.com/TypeStrong/ts-node/issues/1007)

### Affected dependencies:

- `globby`

## Change Case

Since v5.0.0 `change-case` decided to provide just a modern _ESM_ build with their latest npm package. Unfortunately
there's no stable way of using it with Node or TS-Node.

### Affected dependencies:

- `change-case`

## Nextjs

Currently fixed to `15.4.0` since it causes issues with build process. Error:

```
TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'props')
    at l.render (.next/server/chunks/9863.js:10:1822) {
  digest: '1042952660'
}
Export encountered an error on /link-tile-model-signature/page: /link-tile-model-signature, exiting the build.
```

The canary release `15.3.0-canary.98` is the last version where this error does not occur, `15.3.0-canary.99` is where
this problem starts. [Here](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/compare/v15.4.0-canary.98...v15.4.0-canary.99) are the
changes between these two versions.

After starting with `next dev`, the following error is shown in the console:

```
[nextjs]  тип TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'props')
[nextjs]     at DSRLinkTileModelSignature.render (../../dist/react-wrapper/ssr/esm/components-react/projects/react-ssr-wrapper/src/lib/dsr-components/link-tile-model-signature.mjs:25:35)
[nextjs]   23 |             : child);
[nextjs]   24 |         const primaryLink = manipulatedChildren.find((child) => typeof child === 'object' && 'props' in child && child.props.variant === 'primary');
[nextjs] > 25 |         const linkEl = primaryLink.props.href

[nextjs]   27 |             : (Array.isArray(primaryLink.props.children) ? primaryLink.props.children : [primaryLink.props.children]).find((child) => child.type === 'a' || child.props.href || child.props.to // href and to check is for framework links
[nextjs]   28 |             ).props; // support for slotted a tag within p-link {
[nextjs]   digest: '3656165356'
[nextjs] }
[nextjs]  GET /link-tile-model-signature 500 in 2268ms
```

When `'use client';` is added from the top of the file, the error disappears.
