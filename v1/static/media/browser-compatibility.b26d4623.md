With Porsche UI Kit we secure the visual and functional compatibility without any code optimisation of all contents for a defined set of browsers and versions. The supported set is defined and updated based on a quarterly usage analysis. To consider local differences in our greatest markets the possible deviation of China, USA, Germany is determined.

All browser versions that have less than 1% share of the total sessions do not need to be supported anymore.
