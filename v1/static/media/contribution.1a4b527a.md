# Contribution

Porsche UI Kit is used by many teams and should be also maintained by many teams. We serve several possibilities to collaborate and be part of the product:
* Slack channel #p-porsche-ui-kit
* E-Mail newsletter [subscribe to mailing list](http://eepurl.com/ghVSjH)
* Ui Kit Sync - a bi-weekly meeting
* Design- and code contribution 

## Code contribution and collaboration
Until the release of version 1.0.0 of Porsche UI Kit, which is a complete rewrite, we can't grant access to the GitHub repository. We will define a workflow for contributors who want to design and develop new components. As soon as we have set up a collaboration workflow we will inform you in the Slack channel.
