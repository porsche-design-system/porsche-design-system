# Porsche Pattern Lab baesd on Pattern Lab Node - Gulp Edition

The Gulp wrapper around [Pattern Lab Node Core](https://github.com/pattern-lab/patternlab-node) providing tasks to interact with the core library and move supporting frontend assets.

## Packaged Components

The Gulp Edition comes with the following components:

* `patternlab-node`: [GitHub](https://github.com/pattern-lab/patternlab-node), [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/patternlab-node)
* `patternengine-node-mustache`: [GitHub](https://github.com/pattern-lab/patternengine-node-mustache), [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/patternengine-node-mustache)
* `pattern-lab/styleguidekit-assets-default`: [GitHub](https://github.com/pattern-lab/styleguidekit-assets-default)
* `pattern-lab/styleguidekit-mustache-default`: [GitHub](https://github.com/pattern-lab/styleguidekit-mustache-default)

## Prerequisites

The Pattern Lab Node - Gulp Edition uses [Node](https://nodejs.org) for core processing, [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) to manage project dependencies, and [gulp.js](http://gulpjs.com/) to run tasks and interface with the core library. Node version 4 or higher suffices. You can follow the directions for [installing Node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) on the Node website if you haven't done so already. Installation of Node will include npm.

It's also highly recommended that you [install gulp](hhttps://github.com/gulpjs/gulp/blob/4.0/docs/getting-started.md) globally.

> Note: The Gulp Edition of Pattern Lab uses Gulp 4, which may require a new global install of the Gulp command line interface. Follow the [gulp upgrade instructions](https://github.com/pattern-lab/edition-node-gulp/wiki/Updating-to-Gulp-4) if you already have gulp installed and need to upgrade. Gulp 4 is in alpha, but brings many benefits to the table and is relatively stable. You can alternatively [run with local gulp instead of global gulp](https://github.com/pattern-lab/patternlab-node/wiki/Running-with-Local-Gulp-Instead-of-Global-Gulp), but commands are a bit more verbose. The rest of this documentation assumes a global install.

## Installing

    ```
    npm install
    ```

Running `npm install` will prompt you for the required tab settings -> please enter "scss" and hit the ENTER key to continue

## Getting Started

The Pattern Lab Node - Gulp Edition ships with a [base experience](https://github.com/pattern-lab/starterkit-mustache-base) which serves as clean place to start from scratch with Pattern Lab. But if you want to get rolling with a starterkit of your own, or use the [demo starterkit](https://github.com/pattern-lab/starterkit-mustache-demo) like the one on [demo.patternlab.io](http://demo.patternlab.io), you can do so automatically at time of `npm install` by adding your starterkit to the `package.json` file.

You can also [work with starterkits using the command line](https://github.com/pattern-lab/patternlab-node/wiki/Importing-Starterkits).

## Updating Pattern Lab

To update Pattern Lab please refer to each component's GitHub repository, and the [master instructions for core](https://github.com/pattern-lab/patternlab-node/wiki/Upgrading). The components are listed at the top of the README.

## Helpful Commands

These are some helpful commands you can use on the command line for working with Pattern Lab.

> Reminder: These commands assume a global installation of gulp 4.X, instead of a local installation. Depending on your preference, you may need to [upgrade your global version of gulp](https://github.com/pattern-lab/edition-node-gulp/wiki/Updating-to-Gulp-4) or [run with local gulp](https://github.com/pattern-lab/patternlab-node/wiki/Running-with-Local-Gulp-Instead-of-Global-Gulp).
