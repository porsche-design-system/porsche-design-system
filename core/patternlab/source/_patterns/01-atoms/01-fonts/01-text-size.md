Whenever a text is used on a picture it's obligatory to use regular font weight. In general a thin
font weight is only a available by at least a font size of 20px.

-text-size-1-regular to -5 definitions are not necessarily connected to <h1> to <h5>, they can be used on 
any HTML tag independent of their semantic meaning. To make an extreme example, when it makes sense from
visual and semantic perspective it's okay to use following combination: <h5 class="-text-size-1-regular"></h5>.
