The vimeo player, as you can see here, does not correspond to the official porsche design. The reason is that the design comes with the video itself and is linked to the official porsche vimeo channel. The porsche vimeo channel cannot be accessed from patternlab. Example for a video with the correct skin would be https://vimeo.com/266819535.
