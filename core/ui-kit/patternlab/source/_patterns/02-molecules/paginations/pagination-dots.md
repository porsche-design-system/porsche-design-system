This is a pagination indicator relying on dots.

Alternate colored versions exist for various backgrounds (light, grey, dark, images etc.).

The default dot colors are set for *light* backgrounds.

Available classes:

* pagination-dots__dot--type-grey
* pagination-dots__dot--type-black
* pagination-dots__dot--type-image

The fourth and fifth dot decreases in size, but not any further. Please take the sample pattern and design spec as reference.

Available classes to change their *size* are:

* pagination-dots__dot--size-secondary
* pagination-dots__dot--size-tertiary
