This is a pagination indicator relying on grey/red dots.

Alternate versions exist for light, dark and image based backgrounds.

The default colors are set for *light* backgrounds.

Available classes:

* pagination-dots--dark
* pagination-dots--image

The fourth and fifth dot decreases in size, but not any further. Please take the sample pattern as reference.

Available classes to change their *size* are:

* pagination-dots__dot--size-secondary
* pagination-dots__dot--size-tertiary
