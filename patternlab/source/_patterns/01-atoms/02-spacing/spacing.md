title: Spacing
state: inprogress

By default spacing-3 to -60 classes will apply only margin-top when used on markup level to increase 
maintainability and avoiding margin collapse. There are also corresponding scss mixins available which
can be configured to use margin or padding in any direction. Spacing mixins are preferred to use on scoped
CSS BEM components instead of corresponding CSS classes for usage on markup level to furthermore increase 
maintainability.
