#### What to do when vrt or cbt tests are failing
1. Switch to your results directory in `/packages/{DESIRED_PACKAGE_NAME}/tests/{vrt/cbt}/results`. Here you can find the belonging `diff` and `regression` images.
1. Check if you would like to accept the changes
     * **If yes**: Replace the reference shot in the `/{vrt/cbt}/fixtures` folder with the belonging one in the `/{vrt/cbt}/results` folder and delete the images in the `/{vrt/cbt}/results` directory afterwards manually.
     * **If no**: Recheck your code and run the tests again, when you think you fixed it.

### Prepare Release
_Caution: only use this task if you know exactly what you are doing. In case something goes wrong make sure to revert all local changes before executing the task again._
1. Switch to __project root directory__
1. Run `./docker.sh run-prepare-release ${VERSION}`

### Deploy
_It's a job exclusively for the CI/CD pipeline, that's why it should not be executed locally._
1. Switch to __project root directory__
1. Run `./docker.sh run-deploy`

### Slack
_It's a job exclusively for the CI/CD pipeline, that's why it should not be executed locally._
1. Switch to __project root directory__
1. Run `./docker.sh run-slack`

## Dependency updates
Every week, we update our NPM packages:

1. Switch to __project root directory__
1. Run `./docker.sh run-upgrade`  
This should output the dependencies you might want to update. Select the NPM dependencies to be updated and press
_Enter_. Afterwards execute automated tests to make sure application still works.
1. Angular has to be updated with `ng update`.
    1. Run `./docker.sh bash`
    1. `cd packages/components-angular`
    1. `./node_modules/.bin/ng update`
    1. `./node_modules/.bin/ng update @angular/cli @angular/core`
    1. `exit` to leave the docker container
1. Run `./docker.sh run-build`  
1. Run `./docker.sh run-lint`  
1. Run `./docker.sh run-test-unit`  
1. Run `./docker.sh run-test-e2e`  
1. Run `./docker.sh run-test-vrt`  
1. Run `./docker.sh run-test-cbt`  
As final check start application locally and have a look at it.
1. Run `./docker.sh run-start`

### Hints for updating
1. Make sure you pulled the latest version before starting
1. NPM registry is linked to a private one (jFrog Artifactory). Make sure you've followed instructions mentioned in
__Getting started__ section to be able to authenticate during NPM dependency update process.

[GitHub Actions](https://github.com/porscheui/porsche-design-system/actions)


## Developing new components

This tool automatically creates a catalog of ui components. For its magic to work, new components have to follow a few rules:

1. **File location:** A component is developed as a self containing element under `packages/components-js/src/components`.
1. **Component description:** A component should have a `COMPONENTNAME.code.md` and a `COMPONENTNAME.design.md` file which describes its general purpose, design/development specifications and examples.
1. **Props:** The component has to describe its props using typescript types and documentation.
