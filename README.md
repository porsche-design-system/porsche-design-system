# Porsche Design System

## Build status

[![Actions Status](https://github.com/porscheui/porsche-design-system/workflows/Porsche%20Design%20System/badge.svg)](https://github.com/porscheui/porsche-design-system/actions)

## Setup

### Requirements

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) - make sure to use the same node version as defined in `./docker/node/Dockerfile`
- [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com) ([see below](#docker-installation-steps))

### Getting started

1. Clone [`porsche-design-system` repository](https://github.com/porscheui/porsche-design-system)
1. Switch to **project root directory**
1. Checkout branch **master** by executing `git checkout master`
1. Create an `.env` file within **project root directory** (never push this file to Git because it will contain secrets
   â€“ by default it's ignored by `.gitignore`)
1. Make sure that Docker app is running
1. Create a personal access token with the scopes `delete:packages`, `read:packages`, `write:packages`, `repo` at
   <https://github.com/settings/tokens>
1. Add the personal access token to the `.env` file in following format `GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN=YOUR_TOKEN`
1. Login to the GitHub docker registry via
   `grep GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN .env | cut -d '=' -f2 | docker login https://ghcr.io -u YOUR_USERNAME --password-stdin`
1. Run `./docker.sh run-install` (to have npm dependencies installed within Docker container) - this may take up to
   several minutes at first start depending on your internet connection
1. Run `yarn` (to have npm dependencies installed on your machine for better IDE support) - this may take up to several
   minutes at first start depending on your internet connection

_Note: `./docker.sh run-install` and `yarn` should be executed after every pull._

### Setup prettier

1. Go to Webstorm `Preferences`
1. Click on the Plugins tab and search for `prettier`
1. Install prettier
1. In `Preferences` go to `Languages and Frameworks` -> `Javascript` -> `Prettier`
1. Set `Prettier Package` to `{PATH_TO_YOUR_DIRECTORY}/node_modules/prettier`
1. Change `Run for files` to `{**/*,*}.{js,ts,jsx,tsx,vue,scss,json,css,html,md}`
1. Click checkbox `on save` and apply
1. You should be good to go.
1. If you have to exclude code fom being prettified, see
   [Prettier configuration](https://prettier.io/docs/en/ignore.html#javascript)

### Start

**Important:** before executing a start command it's necessary to have `./docker.sh run-build` executed.

1. Switch to **project root directory**
1. For the different applications, select one of the following commands:

- `./docker.sh run-start` (starts storefront as default)
- `./docker.sh run-start --components`
- `./docker.sh run-start --components-js`

#### What to do when VRT Puppeteer tests are failing

1. Switch to your results directory in `/packages/{DESIRED_PACKAGE_NAME}/tests/vrt/(puppeteer?)/results`. Here you can
   find the belonging `diff` and `regression` images.
1. Check if you would like to accept the changes

- **If yes**: Replace the reference shot in the `/vrt/fixtures` folder with the belonging one in the
  `/vrt/(puppeteer?)/results` folder and delete the images in the `/vrt/(puppeteer?)/results` directory afterwards
  manually.
- **If no**: Recheck your code and run the tests again, when you think you fixed it.

### Smoke Tests

**Note:** In most of the cases this test only make sense to be executed in CI/CD

1. Switch to **project root directory**

- `./docker.sh run-test-smoke` (smoke tests for the entire application)
- `./docker.sh run-test-smoke --components-js` (smoke tests for the native web components)

---

## Docker

#### What to do after adjusting docker scripts

1. Communicate breaking changes of the pipeline to the team (currently the same docker image is used for dev and prod
   builds: [#1124](https://github.com/porscheui/porsche-design-system/issues/1124))
1. Switch to `docker/node` directory
1. Run `bash build-and-push-base-image.sh`
1. View new package on
   [GitHub-Packages Page](https://github.com/orgs/porscheui/packages?repo_name=porsche-design-system)

## Dependency updates

Every week, we update our NPM packages:

1. Switch to **project root directory**
1. Run `./docker.sh run-upgrade`  
   This should output the dependencies you might want to update. Select the NPM dependencies to be updated and press _
   Enter_. Afterwards execute automated tests to make sure application still works.
1. Angular has to be updated with `ng update`.
1. Run `./docker.sh bash`
1. `cd packages/components-angular`
1. `./node_modules/.bin/ng update`
1. `./node_modules/.bin/ng update @angular/cli @angular/core`
1. Check `MAX_TS_VERSION` in `packages/components-angular/node_modules/@angular/compiler-cli/src/typescript_support.js`
   which indicates whether `typescript` can be updated for Angular packages or not.
1. `exit` to leave the docker container
1. Run `./docker.sh run-install`
1. Run `./docker.sh run-build`
1. Run `./docker.sh run-test`  
   As final check start application locally and have a look at it.
1. Run `./docker.sh run-start`

### Hints for updating

1. Make sure you pulled the latest version before starting.
1. NPM registry is linked to a private one (jFrog Artifactory). Make sure you've followed instructions mentioned in **
   Getting started** section to be able to authenticate during NPM dependency update process.
1. To avoid corrupting the `yarn.lock` start with Angular (by using `ng update`). The following upgrades should be
   grouped e.g. if React types can be upgraded also look if React can be upgraded.
1. Don't upgrade too many dependencies at once, keep them logically together.

[GitHub Actions](https://github.com/porscheui/porsche-design-system/actions)

## Developing new components

This tool automatically creates a catalog of ui components. For its magic to work, new components have to follow a few
rules:

1. **File location:** A component is developed as a self containing element under `packages/components/src/components`.
1. **Component description:** A component should have a `COMPONENTNAME.code.md` and a `COMPONENTNAME.design.md` file
   which describes its general purpose, design/development specifications and examples.
1. **Props:** The component has to describe its props using typescript types and documentation.

## AWS

In order to deploy something to AWS from your local machine, you need to follow these steps.

1. Install `awscli` as described here
   <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/install-cliv2-linux.html#cliv2-linux-install>
1. Retrieve the credentials from our keepass, they are stored in the entry `AWS + QuickSight` under the fields
   `ZugriffsschlÃ¼ssel-ID` and `Geheimer ZugriffsschlÃ¼ssel`
1. Run `aws configure` and enter the credentials, default region `eu-central-1` and default output format `json`
1. If you prefer to run commands via `docker.sh` you need to extend your `.env` file by `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and
   `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` with the credentials from the previous step
