## Setup

### Requirements
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org)
* [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com)
* [Docker](https://www.docker.com) ([see below](#docker-installation-steps))

### Getting started
1. Clone [`porsche-design-system` repository](https://github.com/porscheui/porsche-design-system)
1. Switch to __project root directory__
1. Checkout branch __v1__ by executing `git checkout v1`
1. Execute command `npm login --registry=https://porscheui.jfrog.io/porscheui/api/npm/npm/`
1. Enter username, password (Artifactory API Key, __not__ Artifactory password!) and e-mail address when asked in terminal
1. Execute `cat ~/.npmrc`, find following line `//porscheui.jfrog.io/porscheui/api/npm/npm/:_authToken=` and copy the generated _npm registry token_ from the file to your clipboard
1. Create an `.env` file within __project root directory__ (never push this file to Git because it will contain secrets â€“ by default it's ignored by `.gitignore`)
1. Add _npm registry token_ in following format `PORSCHE_NPM_REGISTRY_TOKEN=YOUR_TOKEN_GOES_HERE`

#### What to do when vrt or cbt tests are failing
1. Switch to your results directory in `/packages/{DESIRED_PACKAGE_NAME}/tests/{vrt/cbt}/results`. Here you can find the belonging `diff` and `regression` images.
1. Check if you would like to accept the changes
     * **If yes**: Replace the reference shot in the `/{vrt/cbt}/fixtures` folder with the belonging one in the `/{vrt/cbt}/results` folder and delete the images in the `/{vrt/cbt}/results` directory afterwards manually.
     * **If no**: Recheck your code and run the tests again, when you think you fixed it.

## Dependency updates
Every week, we update our NPM packages:

1. Switch to __project root directory__
1. Run `./docker.sh run-upgrade`  
This should output the dependencies you might want to update. Select the NPM dependencies to be updated and press
_Enter_. Afterwards execute automated tests to make sure application still works.
1. Angular has to be updated with `ng update`.
    1. Run `./docker.sh bash`
    1. `cd packages/components-angular`
    1. `./node_modules/.bin/ng update`
    1. `./node_modules/.bin/ng update @angular/cli @angular/core`
    1. Check `MAX_TS_VERSION` in `packages/components-angular/node_modules/@angular/compiler-cli/src/typescript_support.js` which indicates whether `typescript` can be updated for Angular packages or not.
    1. `exit` to leave the docker container
1. Run `./docker.sh run-install`  
1. Run `./docker.sh run-build`  
1. Run `./docker.sh run-test`  
As final check start application locally and have a look at it.
1. Run `./docker.sh run-start`

### Hints for updating
1. Make sure you pulled the latest version before starting
1. NPM registry is linked to a private one (jFrog Artifactory). Make sure you've followed instructions mentioned in
__Getting started__ section to be able to authenticate during NPM dependency update process.

## Developing new components

This tool automatically creates a catalog of ui components. For its magic to work, new components have to follow a few rules:

1. **File location:** A component is developed as a self containing element under `packages/components-js/src/components`.
1. **Component description:** A component should have a `COMPONENTNAME.code.md` and a `COMPONENTNAME.design.md` file which describes its general purpose, design/development specifications and examples.
1. **Props:** The component has to describe its props using typescript types and documentation.
