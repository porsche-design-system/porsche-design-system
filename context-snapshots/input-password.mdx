## Accessibility support

### Keyboard

| Key / state        | Function                                                 |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Tab`, `Shift-Tab` | Moves focus to the next (or previous) focusable element. |

### ARIA enhancements

#### Internal **ARIA** that is managed by the component:

| ARIA                            | Usage                                                                                                 |
| ------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `aria-label="STRING"`           | Defines the accessible name combined with the description and status message.                         |
| `role="status"`, `role="alert"` | When `message` and `state` or `loading` prop change, the status message is announced.                 |
| `aria-hidden="true"`            | If `required` attribute is set, the visible asterisk indicator is hidden from assistive technologies. |
| `aria-invalid="true"`           | If `error` state is set.                                                                              |
| `aria-live="polite"`            | If the `maxlength` attribute is present, the counter is announced via ARIA live region.               |
| `aria-pressed="BOOLEAN"`        | Defines the state of the visibility for the toggle button.                                            |

## Development considerations

### Disabled state

In general, you should prevent using the `disabled` state. Disabled elements are not reachable (focusable) anymore and
can be missed by screen reader users. They can be confusing for sighted users as well by not pointing out why these
elements are disabled.

## Limitations

Due to the nature of **Web Components** and **shadowDOM**, there are limitations in the usage of some **ARIA**
attributes if they try to set relationship between elements in different shadowDOM's or shadowDOM/lightDOM combinations.

| ARIA               | Support |
| ------------------ | ------- |
| `aria-labelledby`  | 🚫      |
| `aria-describedby` | 🚫      |

## Tests

### Automated

| Technology                            | Support |
| ------------------------------------- | ------- |
| AXE-Core (WCAG 2.2 AA, Best-Practice) | ✅      |
| High-Contrast Mode (light/dark)       | ✅      |
| Text-Zoom (200%)                      | ✅      |

### Manual

| Technology                      | Support |
| ------------------------------- | ------- |
| Keyboard                        | ✅      |
| Screen reader (VoiceOver, NVDA) | ✅      |

Vanilla JS:
```html
<!doctype html>
<html lang="en" class="light">
<head>
  <title></title>
</head>
<body class="bg-canvas">

<p-input-password label="Some label" name="some-name" toggle="true"></p-input-password>
<script>

</script>
</body>
</html>
```

React:
```jsx
import React from 'react';
import { PInputPassword } from '@porsche-design-system/components-react';

export const Example = () => {
  return (
    <>
      <PInputPassword label="Some label" name="some-name" toggle={true}></PInputPassword>
    </>
  )
}
```

Angular:
```typescript
import { ChangeDetectionStrategy, Component } from '@angular/core';
import { PorscheDesignSystemModule } from '@porsche-design-system/components-angular';

@Component({
  selector: 'porsche-design-system-app',
  template: `
      <p-input-password label="Some label" name="some-name" [toggle]="true"></p-input-password>
  `,
  changeDetection: ChangeDetectionStrategy.OnPush,
  standalone: true,
  imports: [PorscheDesignSystemModule], // <-- PDS module is imported here
})
export class ExampleComponent {}
```

Vue:
```vue
<script setup lang="ts">
  import { PInputPassword } from '@porsche-design-system/components-vue';
</script>

<template>
  <PInputPassword label="Some label" name="some-name" :toggle="true"></PInputPassword>

# Input Password (Component: p-input-password)

The `p-input-password` component enables secure password entry by obscuring the typed characters. Displayed as a
one-line plain text editor, it ensures the password remains hidden to protect user privacy. Additionally, the component
includes a toggle button that allows users to reveal the password in clear text when needed, offering both security and
convenience.

A `label` is a caption which informs the user what information a particular form field is asking for. The
`p-input-password` component can be used with or without a label, but it's recommended to keep the label visible for
better accessibility whenever possible. When used without a label, it's mandatory to provide a descriptive label text
for screen readers.

While a `placeholder` is optional but recommended to be set whenever bits of example content or hints shall be shown to
give the user visual cues to fill out the form.

<FrameworkNotification showForFrameworks={['react']} heading="Input Event Handling">
  React's `onChange` behaves like the native `onInput` (fires on every keystroke). However, our web components follow
  standard browser behavior, where `onChange` only fires when the input loses focus. To get real-time updates on each
  keystroke, use `onInput` instead.

## Form

The `p-input-password` can be integrated into a form in two ways: **controlled** or **uncontrolled**, depending on your
needs.

In the **controlled** approach, the input state is externally managed using the `value` property and `input` event to
keep it in sync with your application logic. This approach is ideal for complex forms or when using a form library. Note
that the component will still always update its internal value automatically when interacted with.

In the **uncontrolled** approach, the input behaves similar to a native `<input type="password" />`, automatically
managing its own state and including its value in form submissions through the
[ElementInternals](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/ElementInternals) API. This is convenient for
smaller forms or simple submissions.

For more details on form integration, refer to the `Form` section in the
[developing documentation](/developing/introduction) for your framework of choice, or find a full form integration
example in our [examples repository](https://github.com/porsche-design-system/examples/tree/v3/frameworks).

<!-- Component Example (interactive demo) -->

## Show password toggle button

If you want to show the password toggle button, you can pass `toggle="true"`.

<!-- Component Story example (code examples shown above) -->

## Slots

Sometimes it's useful to be able to render markup (e.g. an anchor tag) for `label`, `description` or `message`.
Therefore, a named slot can be used. Make sure **not** to define the corresponding property on the host element when a
named slot is used (because a property definition is preferred over a named slot). For named slots only
[phrasing content](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/HTML/Content_categories#Phrasing_content) is
allowed.

## Usage

The following segment provides instructions for designers and developers regarding the appropriate utilization of this
component in various situations.

### Do:

- Use when a text input of the user is required or optional.
- Use for password input.
- Use without a label only when the context is clear.
- Use for validation and error of input.
- Use asterisk for required fields.

### Don't:

- Don't use labels with more than two words whenever possible (keep it short and descriptive).
- Don't use instructional or description text for the label.
