# Canvas (Component: p-canvas)

The `p-canvas` is an experimental layout component for productive web applications.

The canvas component provides a CSS utility class which comes with a basic 12 columns
[CSS grid](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid) and
[CSS container-type](https://css-tricks.com/css-container-queries). The utility class can be used in default or footer
slot to align its content.

```scss
.-p-canvas-grid // experimental, might be removed in a future release
```

The canvas component has some values which can be overwritten by **CSS Variables**.

```scss
--p-canvas-sidebar-start-width: 220px;
--p-canvas-sidebar-end-width: 180px;
```

<!-- Component Example (interactive demo) -->

## Usage

The following segment provides instructions for designers and developers regarding the appropriate utilization of the p-canvas layout component in various application contexts.

### Do:

- Use p-canvas to structure complex application layouts with sidebars, headers, and footers in a consistent, responsive manner.
- Use named slots (sidebar-start, sidebar-end, header-start, footer, etc.) to separate concerns and improve maintainability.
- Use the -p-canvas-grid utility class to create a 12-column layout inside the canvas content or footer areas.
- Combine p-canvas with CSS Grid column helpers (e.g. grid-column: span 4) to align content efficiently.
- Use the sidebarStartOpen and sidebarEndOpen bindings to dynamically control sidebar behavior based on viewport size or user actions.
- Customize layout widths via CSS variables like --p-canvas-sidebar-start-width and --p-canvas-sidebar-end-width to match your design needs.
- Use slot="background" for decorative media like images or videos that sit below the main content, enhancing visual appeal.
- Consider keyboard and focus management when using dynamic flyouts or sidebars, especially on mobile.

### Don’t:

- Don’t use p-canvas for simple or static content pages where a standard layout is sufficient.
- Don’t place critical content only inside sidebars or sticky areas without providing access via the main layout.
- Don’t rely solely on custom styling; instead, use provided slots and layout classes to maintain consistency.
- Don’t nest p-canvas within another p-canvas; this may lead to unpredictable layout behavior.
- Don’t overload the p-canvas with too many sticky elements that compete for screen space, especially on smaller viewports.
- Don’t use -p-canvas-grid outside of canvas slots—it is experimental and might be removed in future releases.
- Don’t override CSS variables globally without scoping, as this can break other usages in your application.
