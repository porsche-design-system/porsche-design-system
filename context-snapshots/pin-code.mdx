## Accessibility support

### Keyboard

| Key / state        | Function                                                 |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Tab`, `Shift-Tab` | Moves focus to the next (or previous) focusable element. |

### ARIA enhancements

#### Internal **ARIA** that is managed by the component:

| ARIA                            | Usage                                                                                 |
| ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `aria-label="STRING"`           | References the current position of the input group.                                   |
| `aria-describedby="IDREF"`      | References the accessible description and status messages.                            |
| `role="status"`, `role="alert"` | When `message` and `state` or `loading` prop change, the status message is announced. |

## Development considerations

### Disabled state

In general, you should prevent using the `disabled="true"` state. Disabled elements are not reachable (focusable)
anymore and can be missed by screen reader users. They can be confusing for sighted users as well by not pointing out
why these elements are disabled.

## Tests

# Pin Code (Component: p-pin-code)

The `p-pin-code` component is optimized for entering sequences of digits. The most common use case is for entering
one-time-passwords (OTP) or pin codes. The input fields allow only one digit at a time. When a digit is entered, the
focus shifts automatically to the next input, until every input is filled.

A few things to note:

- Only digits can be entered.
- Only one digit can be entered per input.
- Pressing `Delete` or `Backspace`: If the focussed input is blank and `Delete`/`Backspace` is pressed the focus
  transfers to the next/previous input, and clears the value of the next/previous input (if any). This avoids the need
  to explicitly `Shift+Tab & Delete`/ `Tab & Backspace`.

A `label` is a caption which informs the user what information a particular form field is asking for. The `p-pin-code`
component can be used with or without a label, but it's recommended to keep the label visible for better accessibility
whenever possible. When used without a label, it's best practice to provide a descriptive label text for screen readers.

## Form

The `p-pin-code` can be integrated into a form in two ways: **controlled** or **uncontrolled**, depending on your needs.

In the **controlled** approach, the input state is externally managed using the `value` property and `change` event to
keep it in sync with your application logic. This approach is ideal for complex forms or when using a form library. Note
that the component will still always update its internal value automatically when interacted with.

In the **uncontrolled** approach, the input behaves similar to a single native `<input type="text" />`, automatically
managing its own state and including its value in form submissions through the
[ElementInternals](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/ElementInternals) API.

<Notification heading="Attention" heading-tag="h2" state="warning">
  <code>p-pin-code</code> does not use a single native input internally. As a result, it lacks access to native{' '}
  <code>ValidityState</code>
  properties and <code>validationMessage</code>, and it cannot display the native validation popover. This means
  validation behavior and error display will need to be implemented separately if required.
</Notification>

For more details on form integration, refer to the `Form` section in the
[developing documentation](/developing/introduction) for your framework of choice, or find a full form integration
example in our [examples repository](https://github.com/porsche-design-system/examples/tree/v3/frameworks).

<!-- Component Example (interactive demo) -->

## Copy+Paste and autocomplete

By default, only one input can be changed at a time. The `p-pin-code` component also supports copying and pasting a
value and OTP auto-suggestion on mobile.

The `p-pin-code` component performs basic validation of the pasted value:

- If the pasted string is too long the `p-pin-code` attempts to fill in the other inputs.
- If the pasted value contains whitespaces, these will be removed.
- If the value contains other characters than digits, the value can not be pasted.

Try copy+paste `1234` into any of the inputs in the example below.

## Usage

The following segment provides instructions for designers and developers regarding the appropriate utilization of this
component in various situations.

### Do:

- Use description text to explain the purpose or context of the `p-pin-code` component.
- Use either 4 or 6 fields in the `p-pin-code` component based on your specific use case and security requirements.
- Since only digits can be entered, use for digit codes only.
- Use type `number` for numeric input or `password` for secure input depending on your application's needs.
- Use the component's built-in support for inline validation.
- Use consideration when implementing the component's behavior in a loading state to ensure it remains usable and
responsive during data retrieval or processing.
- If the `p-pin-code` component is isolated e.g. used with only one button use the loading state on the button. This
ensures a consistent and intuitive user experience.

### Don't:

- Don't make the description text overly complex. Keep it concise and focused on clarifying the component's purpose.
- Don't use the wrong field type for your use case. Ensure that type `number` or `password` aligns with the kind of
input expected from users.
