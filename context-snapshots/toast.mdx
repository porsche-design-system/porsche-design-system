## Accessibility support

### Keyboard

| Key / state | Function                                                |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Tab`       | Moves focus to the close button of the `Toast` element. |

### ARIA enhancements

#### Internal **ARIA** that is managed by the component:

| ARIA                 | Usage                                                                                             |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `role="status"`      | When content is populated or changed in `state="info"`, the component announces it unobtrusively. |
| `aria-hidden="true"` | State `icon` is hidden from the screen reader.                                                    |

## Development considerations

### ARIA live announcements

The `Toast` component uses `role="status"` to announce **content changes** for assistive technologies. Therefor it is
**mandatory** that the component is **pre-rendered** and the content (`Toast Item`) is added dynamically.

## Tests

# Toast (Component: p-toast)

The `p-toast` component manages both, the queue and display of toast messages. Therefore, you can only have a single
instance of this component within your application. Its messages are rendered on the `#top-layer` which ensures the
element to be on top of the page, independent of where `p-toast` is placed in the DOM hierarchy (z-index is not relevant
anymore and won't have any effect).

Review the [notification decision tree](/patterns/notifications/decision-tree/) to determine which notification
component is best for a particular scenario.

Queuing messages on `p-toast` component happens via its `addMessage()` method. For Angular users, we offer the
injectable `ToastManager` service, for React, there is the `useToastManager()` hook. Both expose the `addMessage()`
method, which needs to be called with a parameter that has the following structure:

```ts
type ToastMessage = {
  text: string;
  state?: 'info' | 'success';
};
```

The bottom position of the `p-toast` can be adjusted via the `--p-toast-position-bottom` CSS variable.
