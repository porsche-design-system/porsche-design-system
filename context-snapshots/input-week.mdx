## Accessibility support

### Keyboard

| Key / state        | Function                                                 |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Tab`, `Shift-Tab` | Moves focus to the next (or previous) focusable element. |
| `Arrow Up/Down`    | Sets increments/decrements in regards of the steps       |

### ARIA enhancements

#### Internal **ARIA** that is managed by the component:

| ARIA                            | Usage                                                                                                 |
| ------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `aria-describedby="STRING"`     | Defines the accessible description combined with the status message.                                  |
| `role="status"`, `role="alert"` | When `message` and `state` or `loading` prop change, the status message is announced.                 |
| `aria-hidden="true"`            | If `required` attribute is set, the visible asterisk indicator is hidden from assistive technologies. |
| `aria-invalid="true"`           | If `error` state is set.                                                                              |
| `aria-live="polite"`            | If the `maxlength` attribute is present, the counter is announced via ARIA live region.               |

## Development considerations

### Disabled state

In general, you should prevent using the `disabled` state. Disabled elements are not reachable (focusable) anymore and
can be missed by screen reader users. They can be confusing for sighted users as well by not pointing out why these
elements are disabled.

## Limitations

Due to the nature of **Web Components** and **shadowDOM**, there are limitations in the usage of some **ARIA**
attributes if they try to set relationship between elements in different shadowDOM's or shadowDOM/lightDOM combinations.

| ARIA               | Support |
| ------------------ | ------- |
| `aria-labelledby`  | 🚫      |
| `aria-describedby` | 🚫      |

## Tests

### Automated

| Technology                            | Support |
| ------------------------------------- | ------- |
| AXE-Core (WCAG 2.2 AA, Best-Practice) | ✅      |
| High-Contrast Mode (light/dark)       | ✅      |
| Text-Zoom (200%)                      | ✅      |

### Manual

| Technology                      | Support |
| ------------------------------- | ------- |
| Keyboard                        | ✅      |
| Screen reader (VoiceOver, NVDA) | ✅      |

# Input Week (Component: p-input-week)

The `p-input-week` component provides a versatile, user‑friendly interface for entering week values. It supports direct
keyboard input, including arrow-key adjustments for precise changes. It has a start and end slot in order to support
flexible slotted content.

A `label` is a caption which informs the user what information a particular form field is asking for. The `p-input-week`
component can be used with or without a label, but it's recommended to keep the label visible for better accessibility
whenever possible. When used without a label, it's mandatory to provide a descriptive label text for screen readers.

<FrameworkNotification showForFrameworks={['react']} heading="Input Event Handling">
  React's `onChange` behaves like the native `onInput` (fires on every keystroke). However, our web components follow
  standard browser behavior, where `onChange` only fires when the input loses focus. To get real-time updates on each
  keystroke, use `onInput` instead.

## Form

The `p-input-week` can be integrated into a form in two ways: **controlled** or **uncontrolled**, depending on your
needs.

In the **controlled** approach, the input state is externally managed using the `value` property and `input` event to
keep it in sync with your application logic. This approach is ideal for complex forms or when using a form library. Note
that the component will still always update its internal value automatically when interacted with.

In the **uncontrolled** approach, the input behaves similar to a native `<input type="week" />`, automatically managing
its own state and including its value in form submissions through the
[ElementInternals](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/ElementInternals) API. This is convenient for
smaller forms or simple submissions.

For more details on form integration, refer to the `Form` section in the
[developing documentation](/developing/introduction) for your framework of choice, or find a full form integration
example in our [examples repository](https://github.com/porsche-design-system/examples/tree/v3/frameworks).

<!-- Component Example (interactive demo) -->

## Slots

Sometimes it's useful to be able to render markup (e.g. an anchor tag) for `label`, `description` or `message`.
Therefore, a named slot can be used. Make sure **not** to define the corresponding property on the host element when a
named slot is used (because a property definition is preferred over a named slot). For named slots only
[phrasing content](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/HTML/Content_categories#Phrasing_content) is
allowed.

If you need to provide additional information or actions to the user, you can use the `start` and `end` slots. For
example, you might include an icon, a unit, or an action button. Icons and text should use the `contrast-medium` color
to avoid being mistaken for a button.

If you use a `p-button-pure` or a `p-link-pure`, a `padding` and `margin` have to be set with the exposed
`--ref-p-input-slotted-padding` and `--ref-p-input-slotted-margin` CSS Variables.

# Input Week (Component: p-input-week)

## Usage

The following segment provides instructions for designers and developers regarding the appropriate utilization of this
component in various situations.

`p-input-week` is intended for week input scenarios. It should not be used for values that merely happen to consist of
digits. For those cases, consider using another input with an appropriate input mode. For further guidance, see the
[MDN documentation on week inputs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/week#using_date_inputs).

### Do:

- Use when a week value is required or optional.
- Use without a label only when the context is clear.
- Use for validation and error of input.
- Use asterisk for required fields.

### Don't:

- Don't use labels with more than two words whenever possible (keep it short and descriptive).
- Don't use instructional or description text for the label.
