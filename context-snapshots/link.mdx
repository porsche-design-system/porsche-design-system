## Accessibility support

### Keyboard

| Key / state        | Function                                                 |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Tab`, `Shift-Tab` | Moves focus to the next (or previous) focusable element. |
| `Enter`            | Activates the link.                                      |

### ARIA enhancements

#### External **ARIA** provided by the `aria` property:

| ARIA               | Usage                                                                                    |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `aria-label`       | Defines a string value that labels the interactive element.                              |
| `aria-description` | Defines a string value that adds a more detailed description of the interactive element. |
| `aria-current`     | Exposes the current state of the link.                                                   |
| `aria-haspopup`    | Defines that the link opens a popup (e.g. `dialog`).                                     |

#### Internal **ARIA** that is managed by the component:

| ARIA                 | Usage                                                                   |
| -------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `aria-hidden="true"` | When the `icon` prop is set, the icon is hidden from the screen reader. |

## Development considerations

### Labelling

If the text of a link does not clearly indicate what the link's target is, add a brief, descriptive label using the
`aria` property with the `aria-label` value to provide more context for e.g. screen reader users. Phrases like "Detail"
or "Click" can be unclear when read out of context by a screen reader. In such instances, provide an alternative text
that offers more detailed information, such as "Details of product XYZ."

# Link (Component: p-link)

The `p-link` component is essential to perform changes in **page routes**. For an optimal user guidance and dedicated
pursuit of business or sales goals, different types of Links (**Primary** and **Secondary**) are available for usage. A
Link can be used with or without a label, but it's recommended to keep the **label visible** for better **usability**
whenever possible. When used without a label, it is mandatory for **accessibility** to provide a descriptive label text
for screen readers. In case you want the user to execute an action, you should select the [Button](/components/button/)
component instead.

You can use native `click`, `focus`, `focusin`, `blur` and `focusout` events on the `p-link`.

## Framework routing (anchor nesting)

To support custom anchor tags (e.g. framework specific routing) you can provide them as a **slotted element** of the
component.

<!-- Component Story example (code examples shown above) -->

## Link with specific icon

If an icon needs to be implemented, just set another predefined icon. Per default, all icons are fetched from the
Porsche Design System CDN. Just choose an icon name from the `icon` property. If you need to link to another icon hosted
somewhere else, just set the whole icon path to the `iconSource` prop.

## Usage

The following segment provides instructions for designers and developers regarding the appropriate utilization of this
component in various situations.

### Do:

- Use a Link to navigate to another page.
- Use a [Button](/components/button/) instead of a Link if you want to change a state (e.g. send form)
- Use a Primary Link filled for one or two high-priority actions within a page.
- Use a Secondary Link for all other stand-alone Links that aren't high priority.
- Use a [Link Pure](/components/link-pure/) as a subordinated link version in combination with a filled link (primary or
  secondary) or stand-alone when the priority of the action is lower compared to all other link actions within the page.
- Use an Icon and text variant only when appropriate (e.g. external link).
- Use an Icon-only variant only in cases where the user is fully aware of the link function.
- Ensure that the link remains legible even in a multiline state by using max. 100 characters per line.

### Don't:

- Don't use a Primary Link for all links on a page.
- Don't use a multiline Link as it's recommended to keep the text label short and avoid multiline Links.
- Don't use a width that's too wide and makes the link difficult to read.
