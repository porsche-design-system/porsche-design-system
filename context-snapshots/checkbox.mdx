## Accessibility support

### Keyboard

| Key / state        | Function                                                 |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Tab`, `Shift-Tab` | Moves focus to the next (or previous) focusable element. |
| `Space`            | Activates/Deactivates checkbox.                          |

### ARIA enhancements

#### Internal **ARIA** that is managed by the component:

| ARIA                            | Usage                                                                                                 |
| ------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `aria-describedby="IDREF"`      | References the accessible description of status messages.                                             |
| `role="status"`, `role="alert"` | When `message` and `state` or `loading` prop change, the status message is announced.                 |
| `aria-hidden="true"`            | If `required` attribute is set, the visible asterisk indicator is hidden from assistive technologies. |
| `aria-invalid="true"`           | If `error` state is set.                                                                              |

## Development considerations

### Disabled state

In general, you should prevent using the `disabled` state. Disabled elements are not reachable (focusable) anymore and
can be missed by screen reader users. They can be confusing for sighted users as well by not pointing out why these
elements are disabled.

## Tests

# Checkbox (Component: p-checkbox)

The `p-checkbox` component wraps the native HTML input type `checkbox` form element. Checking one box doesn't uncheck
other Checkboxes. By default, Checkboxes are not selected.

A `label` is a caption which informs the user what information a particular form field is asking for. The `p-checkbox`
component can be used with or without a label, but it's recommended to keep the label visible for better accessibility
whenever possible. When used without a label, it's best practice to provide a descriptive label text for screen readers.

## Form

The `p-checkbox` can be integrated into a form in two ways: **controlled** or **uncontrolled**, depending on your needs.

In the **controlled** approach, the checkbox state is externally managed using the `checked` property and `change` event
to keep it in sync with your application logic. This approach is ideal for complex forms or when using a form library.
Note that the component will still always update its internal value automatically when interacted with.

In the **uncontrolled** approach, the checkbox behaves similar to a native `<input type="checkbox" />`, automatically
managing its own state and including its value in form submissions through the
[ElementInternals](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/ElementInternals) API. This is convenient for
smaller forms or simple submissions.

For more details on form integration, refer to the `Form` section in the
[developing documentation](/developing/introduction) for your framework of choice, or find a full form integration
example in our [examples repository](https://github.com/porsche-design-system/examples/tree/v3/frameworks).

<!-- Component Example (interactive demo) -->

## Indeterminate

Mask the visual appearance of a checkbox which has a state in-between checked and unchecked. This is especially useful
for a checkbox that is used to set the state of a group of checkboxes at once. However, this group might have a mixed
state. In this case we recommend to use `checked=false` and `indeterminate=true`.

**Note: The `indeterminate` attribute only affects how the checkbox is shown. The current value is hidden from the user,
but the checkbox still keeps it's `checked` state. You can find more details in
[the specification](https://w3.org/TR/html52/sec-forms.html#dom-htmlinputelement-indeterminate).**

<!-- Component Story example (code examples shown above) -->

## Slots

Sometimes it's useful to render custom markup for `label` or `message`. Therefore, named slots can be used. Make sure
**not** to define the corresponding property on the host element when a named slot is used (because a property
definition is preferred over a named slot). For named slots only
[phrasing content](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/HTML/Content_categories#Phrasing_content) is
allowed.

In addition to the named slots `label` and `message`, there is also a `label-after` slot available. This slot must be
used to render content after the label which is not directly part of it (e.g. an external link or a `popover`
component).

<Notification heading="Attention" heading-tag="h3" state="warning">
  If the <code>p-checkbox</code> is in <code>disabled/loading</code> state
  <strong>and</strong> <code>label</code> or <code>label-after</code> slots are used with focusable UI elements (e.g.
  <code>a</code> or <code>p-popover</code>), the keyboard focus handling has to be managed manually to prevent focusing
  disabled elements (e.g. add <code>tabindex="-1"</code> on those UI elements).
</Notification>

## Usage

The following segment provides instructions for designers and developers regarding the appropriate utilization of this
component in various situations.

### Do:

- Use for a list of options when you want the user to select one, none, or multiple options.
- Use when an explicit action is required to apply to settings.
- Use the default view for checkboxes when no option is selected.
- Use the indeterminate state only as a visual state and not as a direct user interaction.
- Nest when a parent and child relationship is needed.
- Use short and descriptive label text for each checkbox option.
- Provide validation messages for each checkbox option if needed.
- Set vertically left-aligned for better scannability.

### Don't:

- Avoid using when you have more than 8 options to choose from or consider using a [Select](/components/select-wrapper).
- Don't mix [Radio Button](/components/radio-button-wrapper) buttons with checkboxes.
- Don't change the selection of another checkbox when a nested one is clicked. The only exception is when a checkbox is
  used to make a bulk selection of multiple items.
