## Accessibility support

### Keyboard

| Key / state        | Function                                                 |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Tab`, `Shift-Tab` | Moves focus to the next (or previous) focusable element. |
| `Enter`, `Space`   | Activates the button.                                    |
| `disabled`         | Button still focusable.                                  |

### ARIA enhancements

#### External **ARIA** provided by the `aria` property:

| ARIA               | Usage                                                                                                                                         |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `aria-label`       | Defines a string value that labels the interactive element.                                                                                   |
| `aria-description` | Defines a string value that adds a more detailed description of the interactive element.                                                      |
| `aria-expanded`    | Exposes a visual state (e.g. expanded/collapsed) of another element.                                                                          |
| `aria-pressed`     | Exposes the `pressed` state of a toggle button.                                                                                               |
| `aria-haspopup`    | Defines that the button opens a popup (e.g. `dialog`). It can be used in combination with `aria-expanded` to indicate the state of the popup. |

#### Internal **ARIA** that is managed by the component:

| ARIA                   | Usage                                                                                     |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `aria-disabled="true"` | When `disabled` prop is set, this ARIA attribute is set on the button element.            |
| `role="status"`        | When `loading` prop is set, the component announces the loading state (start and finish). |
| `aria-hidden="true"`   | When the `icon` prop is set, the icon is hidden from the screen reader.                   |

## Limitations

Due to the nature of **Web Components** and **shadowDOM**, there are limitations in the usage of some **ARIA**
attributes if they try to set relationship between elements in different shadowDOM's or shadowDOM/lightDOM combinations.

| ARIA                    | Support |
| ----------------------- | ------- |
| `aria-labelledby`       | 🚫      |
| `aria-describedby`      | 🚫      |
| `aria-owns`             | 🚫      |
| `aria-controls`         | 🚫      |
| `aria-activedescendant` | 🚫      |

## Development considerations

### Labelling

If the text of a button does not clearly indicate what the button's behavior is, add a brief, descriptive label using
the `aria` property with the `aria-label` value to provide more context for e.g. screen reader users. Phrases like
"Add", "Detail" or "Show" can be unclear when read out of context by a screen reader. In such instances, provide an
alternative text that offers more detailed information, such as "Add item XYZ to shopping cart" or "Details of product
XYZ."

# Button (Component: p-button)

The `p-button` component is essential for performing form or **interaction** events. For an optimal user guidance and
dedicated pursuit of business or sales goals, different types of Buttons (**Primary** and **Secondary**) are available
for usage. A Button can be used with or without a label but it's recommended to keep the **label visible** for better
**usability** whenever possible. When used without a label, it is mandatory for **accessibility** to provide a
descriptive label text for screen readers. Whenever you want to provide navigational elements, stick to the
[Link](/components/link/) component instead.

You can use native `click`, `focus`, `focusin`, `blur` and `focusout` events on the `p-button`.

# Button (Component: p-button)

## Form

When used as a submit button, the `name` and `value` props are submitted as a pair as part of the form data.

<!-- Component Example (interactive demo) -->

## Form Attribute

When a button is used as a submit or reset button outside a form, the `form` attribute can be utilized to explicitly
associate the button with a specific form element.

<Notification heading="Attention" heading-tag="h2" state="warning">
  When using the <code>p-button</code> component as a <strong>submit</strong> or <strong>reset</strong> button outside a
  form, it relies on the{' '}
  <Link href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/ElementInternals">ElementInternals</Link> API, which has
  limited browser support.
  <br />
  <br /> As of now, the submitter in the form event is null because the button cannot be accessed within the shadow DOM
  to be passed as an argument to the <code>requestSubmit()</code> function (
  <Link href="https://github.com/WICG/webcomponents/issues/814">WICG/webcomponents#814</Link>).
  <br />
  <br />
  Additionally, custom components using ElementInternals may include all values of elements with the same name attribute
  in form data, rather than only the value of the triggering element, deviating from native form behavior.

## Usage

The following segment provides instructions for designers and developers regarding the appropriate utilization of this
component in various situations.

### Do:

- Use buttons for actions that have clear consequences, such as submitting a form or initiating a purchase.
- Use buttons to indicate the next step in a process, such as "Continue" or "Next".
- Use buttons with clear and concise labels that accurately describe the action they perform.
- Use the primary button for the most important or desired action, and use the secondary button for less important or
  secondary actions.
- Use icons in buttons to enhance their meaning, but ensure the icon is relevant and easily recognizable.
- Use disabled buttons to indicate actions that are currently unavailable or incomplete, and provide context for why the
  button is disabled.

### Don't:

- Don't use buttons for non-actionable elements, such as decorative graphics or text.
- Don't use ambiguous or unclear labels for buttons, as it can lead to confusion for users.
- Don't use too many buttons on a page or in a single section, as it can overwhelm users and reduce usability.
- Don't use primary and secondary buttons interchangeably, as it can confuse users and reduce the clarity of your
  interface.
- Don't use disabled buttons without providing context for why the button is disabled. This can lead to confusion and
  frustration for users.
