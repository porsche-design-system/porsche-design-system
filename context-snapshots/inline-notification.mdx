## Accessibility support

### Keyboard

| Key / state        | Function                                   |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------ |
| `Tab`, `Shift-Tab` | Moves focus to the next focusable element. |

### ARIA enhancements

#### Internal **ARIA** that is managed by the component:

| ARIA                       | Usage                                                                                                    |
| -------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `role="status"`            | When content is populated or changed in `state="info"`, the component announces it unobtrusively.        |
| `role="alert"`             | When content is populated or changed in `state="warning/error"`, the component announces it immediately. |
| `aria-labelledby="IDREF"`  | References the accessible name.                                                                          |
| `aria-describedby="IDREF"` | References the accessible description.                                                                   |
| `aria-hidden="true"`       | State `icon` is hidden from the screen reader.                                                           |
| `aria-controls="IDREF"`    | Exposes relationship of close button.                                                                    |

## Development considerations

### ARIA live announcements

The `Inline Notification` component uses `role="status"` and `role="alert"` to announce **content changes** for
assistive technologies, but only if the component is **pre-rendered** and the content is added dynamically.

## Tests

### Automated

| Technology                            | Support |
| ------------------------------------- | ------- |
| AXE-Core (WCAG 2.2 AA, Best-Practice) | ✅      |
| High-Contrast Mode (light/dark)       | ✅      |
| Text-Zoom (200%)                      | ✅      |

### Manual

| Technology                      | Support |
| ------------------------------- | ------- |
| Keyboard                        | ✅      |
| Screen reader (VoiceOver, NVDA) | ✅      |

# Inline Notification (Component: p-inline-notification)

The `p-inline-notification` is a controlled component that provides action-based feedback messages (e.g. after
performing a task) or to convey informational and/or critical notification like some site related topics.

Review the [notification decision tree](/patterns/notifications/decision-tree/) to determine which notification component
is best for a particular scenario.

## Event Handling

The custom event that is emitted on close button click is called `dismiss`.
It can be used to remove the component.

<!-- Component Example (interactive demo) -->

### Action Button

A custom interaction, e.g., to retry the previous action like submitting a form, can be provided by setting the optional
`actionLabel`, `actionIcon` and `actionLoading` properties.
The custom event that is emitted on action button click is called `action`.

<!-- Component Example (interactive demo) -->
