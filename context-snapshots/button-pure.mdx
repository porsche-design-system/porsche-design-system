## Accessibility support

### Keyboard

| Key / state        | Function                                                 |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Tab`, `Shift-Tab` | Moves focus to the next (or previous) focusable element. |
| `Enter`, `Space`   | Activates the button.                                    |
| `disabled`         | Button still focusable.                                  |

### ARIA enhancements

#### External **ARIA** provided by the `aria` property:

| ARIA               | Usage                                                                                                                                         |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `aria-label`       | Defines a string value that labels the interactive element.                                                                                   |
| `aria-description` | Defines a string value that adds a more detailed description of the interactive element.                                                      |
| `aria-expanded`    | Exposes a visual state (e.g. expanded/collapsed) of another element.                                                                          |
| `aria-pressed`     | Exposes the `pressed` state of a toggle button.                                                                                               |
| `aria-haspopup`    | Defines that the button opens a popup (e.g. `dialog`). It can be used in combination with `aria-expanded` to indicate the state of the popup. |

#### Internal **ARIA** that is managed by the component:

| ARIA                   | Usage                                                                                     |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `aria-disabled="true"` | When `disabled` prop is set, this ARIA attribute is set on the button element.            |
| `role="status"`        | When `loading` prop is set, the component announces the loading state (start and finish). |
| `aria-hidden="true"`   | When the `icon` prop is set, the icon is hidden from the screen reader.                   |

## Limitations

Due to the nature of **Web Components** and **shadowDOM**, there are limitations in the usage of some **ARIA**
attributes if they try to set relationship between elements in different shadowDOM's or shadowDOM/lightDOM combinations.

| ARIA                    | Support |
| ----------------------- | ------- |
| `aria-labelledby`       | 🚫      |
| `aria-describedby`      | 🚫      |
| `aria-owns`             | 🚫      |
| `aria-controls`         | 🚫      |
| `aria-activedescendant` | 🚫      |

## Development considerations

### Labelling

If the text of a button does not clearly indicate what the button's behavior is, add a brief, descriptive label using
the `aria` property with the `aria-label` value to provide more context for e.g. screen reader users. Phrases like
"Add," "Detail," or "Show" can be unclear when read out of context by a screen reader. In such instances, provide an
alternative text that offers more detailed information, such as "Add item XYZ to shopping cart" or "Details of product
XYZ."

Vanilla JS:
```html
<!doctype html>
<html lang="en" class="light">
<head>
  <title></title>
</head>
<body class="bg-canvas">

<p-button-pure>
  Some label
</p-button-pure>

import React from 'react';
import { PButtonPure } from '@porsche-design-system/components-react';

export const Example = () => {
  return (
    <>
      <PButtonPure>
        Some label
      </PButtonPure>
    </>
  )
}

import { ChangeDetectionStrategy, Component } from '@angular/core';
import { PorscheDesignSystemModule } from '@porsche-design-system/components-angular';

@Component({
  selector: 'porsche-design-system-app',

# Button Pure (Component: p-button-pure)

The `p-button-pure` component is essential to perform events for **interactions**. A Button can be used with or without
a label, but it's recommended to keep the **label visible** for better **usability** whenever possible. When used
without a label, it is mandatory for **accessibility** to provide a descriptive label text for screen readers.

Whenever you want to provide navigational elements, stick to the [Link](/components/link/) or
[Link Pure](/components/link-pure/) component instead.

Similarly to the `p-button`, the `p-button-pure` can be used as a submit button within a form for which a `name` and
`value` prop can be passed. See the [Button Form Example](/components/button/examples/#form) for more information.

You can use native `click`, `focus`, `focusin`, `blur` and `focusout` events on the `p-button-pure`.

## Button Pure with custom clickable/focusable area

Sometimes it might be useful to enlarge the clickable/focusable area of a button to fulfill accessibility guidelines.
Therefore, a custom padding can be set on the host element.

<!-- Component Story example (code examples shown above) -->

## Form

When used as a submit button, the `name` and `value` props are submitted as a pair as part of the form data.

<!-- Component Example (interactive demo) -->

## Form Attribute

When a button is used as a submit or reset button outside a form, the `form` attribute can be utilized to explicitly
associate the button with a specific form element.

<Notification heading="Attention" heading-tag="h2" state="warning">
  When using the <code>p-button-pure</code> component as a <strong>submit</strong> or <strong>reset</strong> button
  outside a form, it relies on the{' '}
  <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/ElementInternals">ElementInternals</a> API, which has
  limited browser support.
  <br />
  <br /> As of now, the submitter in the form event is null because the button cannot be accessed within the shadow DOM
  to be passed as an argument to the <code>requestSubmit()</code> function (
  <a href="https://github.com/WICG/webcomponents/issues/814">WICG/webcomponents#814</a>).
  <br />
  <br />
  Additionally, custom components using ElementInternals may include all values of elements with the same name attribute
  in form data, rather than only the value of the triggering element, deviating from native form behavior.

## Usage

The following segment provides instructions for designers and developers regarding the appropriate utilization of this
component in various situations.

### Do:

- Use Button Pure as a more subtle call to action or to execute an action.
- Choose the appropriate variant for your use case, such as Icon and Text or Text only.
- Use Icon left as the default state and stretch only on small viewports or areas.
- Keep the label short and include active verbs to indicate the action.
- Stack Button Pure groups left-aligned to guarantee scannability and legibility.

### Don't:

- Don't use Button Pure as the primary or only call to action.
- Don't use long labels that do not give a clear indication of the action.
- Don't use buttons to link/navigate to other pages. Use regular [Link](/components/link/) instead.
