## Accessibility support

### Keyboard

| Key / state        | Function                                                 |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Tab`, `Shift-Tab` | Moves focus to the next (or previous) focusable element. |

### ARIA enhancements

#### Internal **ARIA** that is managed by the component:

| ARIA                            | Usage                                                                                                 |
| ------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `aria-describedby="STRING"`     | Defines the accessible description combined with the status message.                                  |
| `role="status"`, `role="alert"` | When `message` and `state` or `loading` prop change, the status message is announced.                 |
| `aria-hidden="true"`            | If `required` attribute is set, the visible asterisk indicator is hidden from assistive technologies. |
| `aria-invalid="true"`           | If `error` state is set.                                                                              |
| `aria-live="polite"`            | If the `maxlength` attribute is present, the counter is announced via ARIA live region.               |

## Development considerations

### Exposing the `unit` prop

The `unit` prop is not exposed to assistive technologies by default. If you provide a `unit` abbreviation, you need to
dissolve it in real text through the `description` prop. For example, if you use `kmh`, you can set the `description`
prop to `kilometers per hour`. This way, the screen reader will read out the full text.

### Disabled state

In general, you should prevent using the `disabled` state. Disabled elements are not reachable (focusable) anymore and
can be missed by screen reader users. They can be confusing for sighted users as well by not pointing out why these
elements are disabled.

## Limitations

Due to the nature of **Web Components** and **shadowDOM**, there are limitations in the usage of some **ARIA**
attributes if they try to set relationship between elements in different shadowDOM's or shadowDOM/lightDOM combinations.

| ARIA               | Support |
| ------------------ | ------- |
| `aria-labelledby`  | 🚫      |
| `aria-describedby` | 🚫      |

## Tests

### Automated

| Technology                            | Support |
| ------------------------------------- | ------- |
| AXE-Core (WCAG 2.2 AA, Best-Practice) | ✅      |
| High-Contrast Mode (light/dark)       | ✅      |
| Text-Zoom (200%)                      | ✅      |

### Manual

| Technology                      | Support |
| ------------------------------- | ------- |
| Keyboard                        | ✅      |
| Screen reader (VoiceOver, NVDA) | ✅      |

# Input Text (Component: p-input-text)

The `p-input-text` component provides a versatile, user‑friendly interface for entering freeform text. It supports
direct keyboard input and includes `start` and `end` slots to allow flexible integration of icons, buttons, or other
content within the input field.

A `label` is a caption which informs the user what information a particular form field is asking for. The `p-input-text`
component can be used with or without a label, but it's recommended to keep the label visible for better accessibility
whenever possible. When used without a label, it's mandatory to provide a descriptive label text for screen readers.

While a `placeholder` is optional but recommended to be set whenever bits of example content or hints shall be shown to
give the user visual cues to fill out the form.

<FrameworkNotification showForFrameworks={['react']} heading="Input Event Handling">
  React's `onChange` behaves like the native `onInput` (fires on every keystroke). However, our web components follow
  standard browser behavior, where `onChange` only fires when the input loses focus. To get real-time updates on each
  keystroke, use `onInput` instead.

## Form

The `p-input-text` can be integrated into a form in two ways: **controlled** or **uncontrolled**, depending on your
needs.

In the **controlled** approach, the input state is externally managed using the `value` property and `input` event to
keep it in sync with your application logic. This approach is ideal for complex forms or when using a form library. Note
that the component will still always update its internal value automatically when interacted with.

In the **uncontrolled** approach, the input behaves similar to a native `<input type="text" />`, automatically managing
its own state and including its value in form submissions through the
[ElementInternals](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/ElementInternals) API. This is convenient for
smaller forms or simple submissions.

For more details on form integration, refer to the `Form` section in the
[developing documentation](/developing/introduction) for your framework of choice, or find a full form integration
example in our [examples repository](https://github.com/porsche-design-system/examples/tree/v3/frameworks).

<!-- Component Example (interactive demo) -->

## Slots

Sometimes it's useful to be able to render markup (e.g. an anchor tag) for `label`, `description` or `message`.
Therefore, a named slot can be used. Make sure **not** to define the corresponding property on the host element when a
named slot is used (because a property definition is preferred over a named slot). For named slots only
[phrasing content](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/HTML/Content_categories#Phrasing_content) is
allowed.

If you need to provide additional information or actions to the user, you can use the `start` and `end` slots. For
example, you might include an icon, a unit, or an action button. Icons and text should use the `contrast-medium` color
to avoid being mistaken for a button.

If you use a `p-button-pure` or a `p-link-pure`, a `padding` and `margin` have to be set with the exposed
`--ref-p-input-slotted-padding` and `--ref-p-input-slotted-margin` CSS Variables.

# Input Text (Component: p-input-text)

<!-- Table of Contents -->

## Usage

The following segment provides instructions for designers and developers regarding the appropriate utilization of this
component in various situations.

`p-input-text` is intended for freeform text input scenarios. It is suitable for entering names, addresses, or any other
non-restricted textual content. It should not be used where semantic or functional input types like numbers, emails, or
dates are more appropriate. In such cases, consider using a more specific input type or component optimized for that
data. For further guidance, see the
[MDN documentation on text inputs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/input/text#using_text_inputs).

### Do:

- Use when freeform text input is required or optional.
- Use without a label only when the context is clear.
- Use for validation and error of input.
- Use asterisk for required fields.

### Don't:

- Don't use labels with more than two words whenever possible (keep it short and descriptive).
- Don't use an instructional or description text for the label.
