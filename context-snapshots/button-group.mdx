# Button Group (Component: p-button-group)

The `p-button-group` is a component for wrapping multiple buttons and display them in vertical or horizontal groups with
corresponding spacing and width. By default buttons are displayed in full-width as a vertical stacked group for mobile
viewports (breakpoint XS) and side-by-side in a row for larger viewports.

## Usage

The following segment provides instructions for designers and developers regarding the appropriate utilization of this
component in various situations.

### Do:

- Use a Button Group to consistently align two or more buttons at once.
- Use Primary Button in combination with Button pure.
- Order buttons within a group horizontally or vertically, based on their priority. The most important button (primary)
should be placed first on the left (horizontal) or top (vertical) of the group following the F pattern for optimal
user experience.
- If no primary action is set, consider emphasizing up to two secondary actions to give them slightly higher priority.

### Don't:

- Don't use button groups with too many options, as this can overwhelm users and make it difficult for them to make a
choice.
- Don't use button groups for unrelated actions or options, as this can confuse users and make it difficult for them to
find what they're looking for.
