# Porsche Design System React
React wrappers for Porsche Design System web components package.  

For basic testing of wrapper components, this project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

## Contribution
This package covers 2 different kind of tasks. **1st** it holds all auto generated React wrappers build by Stencil DS, **2nd** it tests all components within a standard Create React App installation to be sure they are rendered correctly.

### React wrapper components
All React wrapper components live in the `projects` folder under `components-wrapper/src/lib`. Don't make any changes to these files because they are auto generated by Stencil DS.

To add a new component which was build by Stencil DS, open `App.tsx`, import the new component and include an example.

### Custom React components
TBD
