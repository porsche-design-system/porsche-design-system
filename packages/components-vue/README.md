## Contribution

This package covers 2 different kind of tasks. **1st** it holds all auto generated Vue wrappers, **2nd** it tests all
components within a standard Create vue installation to be sure they are rendered correctly.

### Vue wrapper components

All vue wrapper components live in the `projects` folder under `vue-wrapper/src/lib`. Don't make any changes to these
files because they are auto generated.
