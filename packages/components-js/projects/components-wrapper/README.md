<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width,initial-scale=1.0" />
    <title>Porsche Design System</title>

## Methodology

Our goal is to provide easy-to-use and well-documented components so that developers donâ€™t need to worry about the
implementation but can focus on easily creating qualitative and consistent digital Porsche experiences. We ensure that
our components are made for everyone and meet latest quality standards of usability, accessibility, performance and
compatibility. In some points the components are built restrictive to define consistent standards for diverse Porsche
applications but ensure enough flexibility to meet different context requirements.
