# Color

Together with other basic elements like typography, iconography or imagery, the
right use of colors gives every UI the specific Porsche feeling and is
therefore one of the most important tools to create a consistent visual
branding. Even more so when it comes to UX, color is to be used intentionally to create
patterns, set emphasis on important elements and, by doing so, provide visual
guidance and information.

The Porsche Design System color system provides two color themes that are based on the Porsche color palette and can be
used for different visual environments. Both themings are to be found in the Porsche Design System Sketch library.

## Porsche Design System color themes

When designing Porsche applications, the first decision to make is whether the content should be displayed in a merely light or dark environment.
That's when the Porsche Design System color themes come into play that come with a limited color set you should stick to for page backgrounds as well as for text and icons: 

- **The Porsche Light Theme should always be first choice.**
- The Porsche Dark Theme is only to be used for exceptional cases, e.g. if an application is to stand out from the rest of visual communication for strategic reasons or if the context of use is unsuitable for a bright shining display. 
  
All Porsche Design System components are optimized for both Light and Dark Theme. 

### Additional elements
For designing additional elements (such as tiles, dividers or other graphical elements) you have several options:

- Use the accessibility-safe colors provided for the theme (Neutral Contrast High and Neutral Contrast Medium), as they guarantee optimal contrast on the theming's backgrounds. This is highly recommended whenever you want to convey important information.
- Neutral Contrast Low is not accessibility-safe and, therefore, recommended to be used only for displaying "nice to have" or merely decorative elements that are not crucial for information perception. 

### Information level

In order to define the colors to be used within the screen the **information level** of the respective elements is crucial. 

- Play with darker/lighter grey shades to make an element stand out from the background or to set emphasize on it. 
- For large screen space make sure to only use the dedicated surface color for your theme (e.g. Surface). 
- Use the brand color only for highlighting single elements.

### Mixing themes
Within certain limits it's allowed to mix the Porsche color themes. For example you could integrate a limited Dark Theme area in your Light Theme
to visually distinguish it from the rest of the content. **Always make sure that the vast majority of the screen consists of the initially chosen theme.**
The color proportion scales for each theme might be a little helper in doing so.

### Color usage
All colors must always be used in 100% opacity.

### Notifications
Notification colors are to be used only to display warnings, error or status messages.
When using notification colors …

- … always make sure not to rely on color only when displaying status (for more information scroll down to *Accessibility*).
- … always check manually if the color contrast is sufficient depending on the Porsche color theme and, therefore, the background color in use.

## Porsche color principles

### Be consistent.
Once you’ve picked a **Porsche color theme** for you UI design you should stick with it within the application.
Ensure consistency by integrating audits in your workflow.

### Be accessible.
Always keep in mind that **not every user gets to experience colors the same way**
due to color blindness, visual impairment or simply because of the environment.
Therefore, you should always care about accessibility.

### Be purposeful.
Use color wisely and always **focus on supporting the user’s needs** and the purpose of the content within the UI.

### Be Porsche.
Generate a dedicated **Porsche feeling** within the UI by using the colors given
in the brand color palette. Avoid using shades or opacity values for the brand
colors.

Sticking to the [Porsche Brand Code](https://brandguide.porsche.com/elements/manual/view/id/548) this means:

- Generous (but also well-considered) use of white space to emphasize the brand’s exclusiveness and high-quality.
- Form follows function – and so does color.
- Use color to support a clean, precise design language. Stick to the essentials and avoid a non-functional decorative use of color.

---

## Accessibility

In order to make content accessible for a wide range of people and to improve the product’s usability in general, we stick to the common [WCAG 2.1 Standard](#/accessibility/guidelines) when designing Porsche web applications.

- Always ensure a sufficient contrast ratio. The combination of text and background color should pass the WCAG AA standard and have a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1 for standard text size and 3:1 for larger text sizes.

- Combinations of other colored elements must pass the WCAG AA standard with a minimum 3:1 ratio, unless it's only a decorative element.

- Don’t rely on color only to convey information (for example when displaying status or error messages). This is of high importance especially in critical cases, e.g. when displaying safety-relevant vehicle data.

## Helpful tools and resources

### Sketch palette
Feel free to download the [Porsche color palette for Sketch](https://designsystem.porsche.com/sketch/porsche-design-system-colors.sketchpalette) in order to use it as "Document Colors" or "Global Colors" in your color picker.
The easiest way to import the palette to Sketch is by using the plugin [Sketch Palettes](https://github.com/andrewfiorillo/sketch-palettes).

### Sketch plugins
- [Stark](https://getstark.co)
- [Color Contrast Analyser](https://github.com/getflourish/Sketch-Color-Contrast-Analyser)
Both plugins help you to check the color contrast of two selected layers in Sketch, no matter if it's text or surface color.

### Web tools
- [Color Oracle](https://colororacle.org/) is a free color blindness simulator for both Windows and Mac, that gives you an impression on how your designs are perceived by visually impaired users.
-  With [Tanaguru Contrast Finder](http://contrast-finder.tanaguru.com/) you can easily check color contrasts on your desired level of accessibility.
