# Content Wrapper
When designing a web page you have different possibilities to layout your content – be it limited to a dedicated width with spacings to the left and right of the viewport ("basic" version), stretched to the largest viewport without any spacing ("extended") or even to the largest total screen width ("fluid").

Technically, all this can be done by using the Content Wrapper component which offers multiple possibilities to define the **horizontal behaviour of your content**. 

**The Content Wrapper enables you to …**
- … define outer spacings between content area and left/right screen side.
- … center the content area within the screen.
- … set a maximum width for the content area.

## Content width variants

Depending on your layout requirements you can choose between the following options for the content area, whereas each of them can be applied module-based to give you a maximum of flexibility for your page layouts:

### Basic (default)

Depending on the screen width the "Basic" variant **includes a margin of 7% or 10% between content area and the left and right screen sides** (100% = full screen width):

| **Viewport** | **Margin** |
|--------------|------------|
| **XS-L (320-1759 px)** | 7% |
| **XL (1760 px or larger)** | 10% |

### Extended

The "Extended" content area includes no defined margin on the left and right of the content and has a maximum width of 1920 px. Thus, in viewport sizes from 1920 px onwards there is a growing white space outside the left and right edge of the content area.

### Fluid

This is the variant of your choice when you want your content to span to the full screen width, containing no margin or visual gap between content area and screen edges.

## Layout approach or: How to combine Content Wrapper with Grid, Flex or …

**The Content Wrapper can house both the Grid and Flex or any custom content.** The principle of how to apply the Content Wrapper component is quite simple – just think "from big to small" when defining the module layouts:
  
1. First of all, you define the **Content Wrapper** type for your layout part based on the content width variants described above.
2. **The content area of each layout part** can then itself be designed by using Grid and/or Flex or any custom way of content layouting, depending on the individual requirements of the module.
