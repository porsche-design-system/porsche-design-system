# Divider

Horizontal or vertical dividers are 1 px lines that are used to create visual separation between related sections of content. 
Dividers can be used as single elements or embedded in components like, for example, tables or accordions.

In Porsche web applications dividers should only be used sparingly as structural elements and only in neutral colors (greyscales), 
supporting the Porsche Brand Code’s core values of maintaining plenty of white space as well as a modern, streamlined look and a clear, precise design.

## Don’ts

### Don't use dividers only to structure content.

Dividers are not the only way to create visual rhythm and hierarchy on a web page. You should always consider other options for structuring content before using dividers, such as: 

* White space / spacings (think of general perception rules like the law of proximity)
* Sizings
* Color (e.g. emphasizing content by using lighter or darker colors)

Sometimes the elements on a page already create a visual structure on their own (like an image grid, for example) and there might be no need for using extra separating elements like dividers.

### Keep decorative use to a minimum.

Dividers should always be used to structure and therefore help the user perceiving the content of a web page. A usage for a purely decorative purpose is possible, but should be kept to an absolute minimum.
