# Checkbox

Use a Checkboxe for a list of options that allow the user to make choices. The choice of one or several options (checked state) or no option (unchecked state). Each checkbox has a label and is independent of all other checkboxes in the list. Checking one box doesn't uncheck the others. By default checkboxes are not selected.

Label text (â‰¤ 20 characters) is used to inform users as to what information is requested for a Checkbox. Every Checkbox should have a label.

## Usage

Checkboxes have several usage patterns:

### Individual choice
A single checkbox is used to select an individual choice.

### Independent choices (zero or more)
A group of Checkboxes is used to select from a set of zero or more choices. (Unlike single-selection controls such as Radio Buttons, users can select any combination of options in a group of Checkboxes.)

### Dependent choices (one or more)
A group of Checkboxes can also be used to select from a set of one or more choices.  Error is displayed when none of the options are selected. A group of Checkboxes is used where at least one protocol must be selected. 

### A stand-alone Checkbox
Is used for a single option that the user can turn on or off.

### Disabled State
All Checkboxes are provided in disabled state. However, disabled states should be avoided whenever possible, as they always tend to disrupt the user and break the user flow.

### Radio Buttons

**Radio Buttons** are used when there is a list of two or more options that are **mutually exclusive** and the user must select exactly one choice. 
In other words, clicking a non-selected Radio Button will deselect whatever other button was previously selected in the list.
