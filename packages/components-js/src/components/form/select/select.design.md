# Select
 
Use a Select dropdown to allows the user to search through a large list of choices and choose one item at a time, similarly to radio buttons. 
Select components are more compact allowing users to save space and prevent from entering erroneous data, since they only show legal choices.

## Content

- **Headings**
!!! TBD !!!

- **Validation message**
Validation text for a select is placed right below the field box (≤ 90 characters). This places the error next to the offending select, 
so there is no confusion for the user as to what field failed validation. Effective error messaging can help the user to understand the problem and how to fix it.

## Usage
 
### Labels
Consider adding text to the field, such as ‘Select one’ to help the user recognize the necessary action.
Describe just the option with the label.
 
### Spacing
Keep enough space between each Select component. Use correct spacings according to the 8 px system.

### Disabled State
All Selects are provided in disabled state. However, disabled states should be avoided whenever possible, as they always tend to disrupt the user and break the user flow.
 
!!! EXAMPLES !!!

## Don'ts
 
- Don´t include too many items whenever possible. If you have many items, consider alternative ways of presenting them.
- Avoid dropdown boxes for data that is highly familiar such as the day, month, or year. Having to find these options in a long menu is tedious, breaks the previous guideline, and can create even more work for users.
- Very long dropdowns that require scrolling make it impossible for users to see all their choices in one glance.
- Avoid dropdown boxes when typing may be faster.
