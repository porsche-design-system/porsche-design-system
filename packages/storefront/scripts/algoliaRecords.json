Product-specific files are stored in different team projects. Team projects are visible for all organisation members by default. Confidential work is stored in private projects, which are only accessible by members on invitation.\n\nFor better discoverability, files and libraries within a project are recommended to be split and named by their features in lower case with hyphenation. All libraries created within the Porsche organisation should be named with the format `porsche-design-system-[projectname].sketch`.\n\n![Abstract file structure](../../assets/abstract-filestructure.png)\n\n### User roles and rights\nUser roles define whether a user can just view or actually work on the stored files. Contributor seats for designers have to be paid and therefore requested [here](http://eepurl.com/gnOIXD).\n- **Contributors, usually designers,** have access to all features including creating, editing and updating files.\n- **Viewers, usually stakeholders and developers,** are only able to view and comment on shared files.\n\nBoth roles can be granted different rights. \n- **Members** of the organisation have access to all public projects and can be invited individually to private projects.\n- **Guests** have to be invited individually for each project to gain access.\n\n### Add members to your private project or invite guests\n1. Login to Abstract\n2. Navigate to your project and click on \"Members\" on the left-hand navigation bar\n3. Click on \"...\" on the right side of a member item to manage their role or remove them from the project\n4. Select \"Invite People\" to add new team members or invite guests",

Tasks that are currently under development are nested in different branches and child branches. To release a finalised task, the specific branch must be merged into the master.\n\n### 1. Start working on a change\nWe open branches for any file change we're doing to avoid having to update the master too frequently. If you would like to pick up where someone else left off in a branch, you can open a child branch.\n\n1. **Create a branch** either from the master or from an existing branch by clicking \"New branch...\" or by opening a file with \"Edit in Sketch\". Sketch files can also be opened untracked to test something without saving.\n2. **Name the branch** including the main topic, effort type or the issue number and your signature letters,  \ne.g. `pagination accessibility recoloring | mb | #44`. For more context, you can also add a description and a status to the branch.\n4. **Save changes in Sketch and sync them** regularly as commits to Abstract by clicking on \"Commit changes\" at the bottom. \n5. **Describe the committed changes** to make them visible for others, e.g. `Changed text color from blue to red`. Commit often and describe what you did. Adding detail of what you accomplished in each commit is useful for you and for your coworkers.\n\n![Abstract branches](../../assets/abstract-branches.png)\n\n### 2. Review and merge changes\nWhen you think you’re done with your branch, you should always add stakeholders or coworkers as reviewers to get feedback on your work before you merge it to the master branch.\n\n1. Select your branch that you would like to be reviewed\n2. Click \"Request Review\" in the top right and type the team members whom you would like to review your changes\n\nUpdating from the master every few weeks is effective for keeping your branch up to date and avoiding a huge workload when you’re finally ready to merge. Once your review has been approved, you’re ready to merge.\n\n1. Select the branch that you would like to merge into the master or a child branch you would like to merge into the parent branch.\n2. Click \"Merge branch\" at the top right and log a short but descriptive change in the notes.\n3. Click the button \"Merge and archive\".\n4. When your local version of the master branch is not up-to-date (often a result of being offline), you get a diverged copy. Be sure to resolve this immediately.\n5. Inform the team about your merging.\n\n### 3. Engineering and stakeholder \"handoff\"\nCollections are very useful in focusing the attention of your fellow designers and stakeholders on the screens you’re modifying. You can arrange them according to the story you’re trying to tell and to give additional context within them.\n",

Simply pass your desired\nprefix to the `prefix` property of `PorscheDesignSystemProvider`.\n\n\n\nIn the following example the `PHeadline` component will render as `<sample-prefix-p-headline>`.",

    "content": "All components, icons, fonts, styles and marque of the Porsche Design System are loaded versioned and chunked from a central CDN\nThis way all web based digital Porsche products share and use the cached and versioned assets regardless of the JS framework used to improve loading performance across the Porsche group.\nOnly a tiny (1.4kb sized) Porsche Design System loader script gets bundled into your application code.\nEverything else gets loaded versioned, cached and chunked from a central CDN ([read more](https://designsystem.porsche.com/latest/performance/cdn)).\nHowever, this also means that you will need an **Internet connection** to render the components in a browser (possibly relevant for development stage or intranet applications).\n\n#### Enabling Micro Frontend Architecture\nIn case of a micro-frontend architecture, multiple instances and versions of the Porsche Design System can be combined in a final application by configurable prefixing technique of the Porsche Design System components during runtime.\nPlease refer to our framework specific guidelines [Vanilla JS](https://designsystem.porsche.com/latest/start-coding/vanilla-js), [Angular](https://designsystem.porsche.com/latest/start-coding/angular) and [React](https://designsystem.porsche.com/latest/start-coding/react).\n\n#### Prevent Flash of Unstyled Content (FOUC) and Flash of Unstyled Text (FOUT)\nTo prevent FOUC/FOUT, the Porsche Design System offers various partials as part of the `@porsche-design-system/components-{js|angular|react}` package to ensure all necessary Porsche Design System fonts and components are fully loaded.\nIf you've used the `@porsche-design-system/partials` package previously, stop using it and replace the integration with the partials provided by `@porsche-design-system/components-{js|angular|react}` package.\nHave a look at our [FOUC/FOUT guidelines](https://designsystem.porsche.com/latest/performance/loading-behaviour).\n\n\n\n#### Added support for China CDN\nOur CDN is configured to forward requests to Chinese CDN automatically when necessary.\nSo you're good to go without any configuration or multiple region specific builds of your application.\nHowever, if you are aiming for the maximum possible performance in China, you can configure which CDN the Porsche Design System must use.\nPlease follow our [CDN guidelines](https://designsystem.porsche.com/latest/performance/cdn) for more information.\n\n#### New/optimized components\n- **Tabs**\n- **Tabs Bar**\n- **Banner**\n- **Modal**\n- Headline\n- Select\n- Pagination\n- Button\n- Button Pure\n- Link\n- Link Pure\n- Spinner\n- Checkbox\n- Radio Button\n\n#### Improved TypeScript support for Angular and React\nTo ensure the best possible typing support, we have refactored our Angular and React wrappers which integrate the native web components of the Porsche Design System.\n\n#### componentsReady() works reliable\nBecause the Porsche Design System components get loaded async at the time they are needed, it might be relevant within your application or test automation to know when those have been initialized.\nTherefore, we provide in all three `@porsche-design-system/components-{js|angular|react}')` packages a reliable helper function `componentsReady()`.\n[Read more about it](https://designsystem.porsche.com/latest/helpers/components-ready).\n\n#### Removed \"blur on focus\"\nNow focus styling is only applied when you navigate through keyboard and ignored by mouse interaction for browsers supporting `:focus-visible` otherwise it will fallback to `:focus` CSS implementation.\n\n#### Changed focus styling for a better compromise between accessibility and visual appearance\nColor and outline of general focus styling has changed to `currentColor` for light/dark theme with an outline of 1px width/offset.\nIf you have custom components build with the usage of our `@porsche-design-system/utilities` package then update it to the latest version (we also provide a focus [SCSS mixin](https://designsystem.porsche.com/latest/utilities/scss/functions) and [JS function](https://designsystem.porsche.com/latest/utilities/js/functions)).\n\n#### Improved geometry of Porsche Next font\nFor better alignment and readability we've changed the geometry of the Porsche Next font which results in a visual change of font size and spacing.\n\n#### Dropped support for IE11 and EdgeHTML according to Porsche's official browser strategy 2021\nIf you still need to support these browsers, you have to stick to `v1.5.x`.\nWe offer a Browser Notification package `@porsche-design-system/browser-notification` to alert users that these browsers are no longer supported.\nIt supports a blocking layer (to be used with Porsche Design System `v2.x`), or a dismissible banner (to be used with Porsche Design System `v1.x`).\nPlease refer to our [Browser compatibility guidelines](https://designsystem.porsche.com/latest/help/browser-compatibility).\n\n#### Changed default type of Button and Button Pure\nTo be in sync with native `<button>` behavior we've changed the default `type` of **Button** and **Button Pure** component.\nThose components will render a button within their Shadow DOM as `<button type=\"submit\">` (previously `<button type=\"button\">`).\n\n- `submit`: The button submits the form data to the server. This is the default if the attribute is not specified for buttons associated with a `<form>`, or if the attribute is an empty or invalid value.\n- `button`: The button has no default behavior, and does nothing when pressed by default. It can have client-side scripts listen to the element's events, which are triggered when the events occur.\n\n#### Changed support for wrapped links around Link, Link Pure and Link Social component\nDue to the support for setting links (`<a href=\"#\">`) in our **Link**, **Link Pure** and **Link Social** components as child, we've removed support for styling the anchor tag (`<a>`) when it surrounds the component.\nSo we recommend changing the position of the `<a>` tag from wrapping the component to a direct slot (child) of it.\n\n\n\n#### Automatic * asterisk symbol to form field labels\nWe added an automatic generated * asterisk symbol to form field labels which have the required attribute.\nThis might lead to a doubled * symbol if you set one by yourself.\n\n\n\n#### Shadow DOM\n`Flex`, `Flex Item`, `Grid` and `Grid Item` now use Shadow DOM, thus you are not able to overwrite styles defined by these components any longer.\n\n---",

    "content": "The transition cause a major break in the UI.\n\nAsk yourself during the entire visual review and iteration process\n\n- Are you using the new Porsche Next?\n- Are you using the color styles correctly?\n- Is the spacing between components correct?\n- Does the general layout still work?\n\n### Please note\n\nUpgrading to the v2 Library will not automatically change any component created in previous version of the Library. For some Components with Text (like Buttons) you have to “Shrink the element to fit the content” in Overrides and if you have\nline-breaks you can set the “auto-size” Alignment.\n\nWe don’t recommend a piece-by-piece migration of your product in production. Teams should perform the migration first in a separate branch (or branches). This allows the creation of new design specs for any possible rough spots in alignment or sizing that may appear in the UI after upgrading.\n\nMeet with stakeholders from design, OM, and engineering to kick off the migration process.\n\nThe font for Porsche remains Porsche Next. The font metrics was redesigned for better clarity and legibility. Work with your development team to discuss how this new metrics might affect your team’s workflow.

Left alignment (F-shaped reading pattern)**\n\nButtons **on standard pages or in on-page forms** are recommended to be placed **left-justified**, supporting a direct user attention flow:  \n  \nThis is based on the [F-shaped reading pattern](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/f-shaped-pattern-reading-web-content-discovered/) which is still followed by the majority of users on common web pages both on mobile and desktop ([Nielsen Norman](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/f-shaped-pattern-reading-web-content/), 2017) and has also been proven in a usability study on forms [by Luke Wroblewski](https://www.lukew.com/ff/entry.asp?571) (2007). \n  \n![F-shaped reading pattern](./assets/patterns-buttons-alignment-left-form.png)\n\n#### **2. Centered alignment**\n\n**In exceptional cases** it's even possible to place Buttons **centered** to their related content: \n\nIf the Button centring contributes to a more aesthetically pleasing look and feel, like, for example, in an image slider where the Buttons should be placed centered to the images:\n  \n  ![Z-shaped reading pattern](./assets/patterns-buttons-alignment-centered-aesthetic.png)\nIf the Button relates to a larger part or even the whole page, e.g. a \"Load more\" Button:\n  \n  ![Z-shaped reading pattern](./assets/patterns-buttons-alignment-centered-load-more.png)\n\n\n#### **3. Smaller viewports**\n\nOn smaller viewports up to 479 px screen width Buttons are always to be placed stacked and full-width. This makes it easier for the user to tap due to a larger visible touch area and also allows to give primary actions more visibility. \"Icon only\" Buttons keep their fix size on all viewports.\n\n![Mobile view for Buttons](./assets/patterns-buttons-alignment-viewport-xs.png)\n\n\n### Multi-line Buttons\n\nThough it's technically possible to use multiline text in Porsche Buttons, it's recommended to keep the Button label short and, therefore, avoid multiline Buttons. \n\n\n<div style=\"background:#F2F2F2; width:100%; margin-top: 64px; padding-top: 32px; padding-left: 42px; padding-bottom: 42px;\">\n    \n    <img src=\"./assets/button-examples.png\" alt=\"Examples for button usage\"/>\n</div>",

    "content": "Alignment\n\nYou can either order Buttons within a group horizontally or vertically. Our general recommendation is to place the buttons according to their priority - the most important button is the most left (horizontal) or on top (vertical).\n\n#### **1. Horizontal alignment**\n\nA group of Buttons can be aligned side-by-side in a row **whenever you want to** **emphasize the relationship between the different actions** and give the user an instant overview on the available options. A classical case for that would be a \"cancel\" / \"submit\" combination. This is **valid for all screens or screen areas with a width of 480 px or larger.**\n  \n![Horizontal alignment of Button groups](./assets/patterns-buttons-groups-horizontal.png)  \n \nButtons that are placed in a horizontal row on larger screens are always to be stacked on mobile (breakpoint XS) or screen areas with a maximum width of 479 px, each of them occupying a separate line, and, as generally defined for mobile, spanning full-width. According to the F pattern the primary call-to-action button should always be placed on top of the button group ([UX Design](https://uxdesign.cc/buttons-placement-and-order-bb1c4abadfcb), 2019). \n  \n![Responsive behaviour of horizontally aligned buttons](./assets/patterns-buttons-groups-horizontal-responsiveness.png)\n\n#### **2. Vertical alignment**\n\nIn case you want the users to **focus on each action separately** you should opt for vertically stacked Buttons, giving the user more space for a careful consideration of the actions provided ([UX Movement](https://uxmovement.com/mobile/optimal-placement-for-mobile-call-to-action-buttons/), 2019).\n\n![Vertical alignment of Button groups](./assets/patterns-buttons-groups-vertical.png)\n\nIn favor of visual harmony, stacked Buttons should always have the same width, aligned with the widest element of the stack (whose length depends on the text contained). \n\n\n### Limit the number of grouped Buttons.\n\nWhen multiple actions are provided at once, it should be easy for the user to grasp. For \"Icon and text\" Buttons **we recommend to go for a maximum of 4 actions at once**, as we should set a limit and don't want to overwhelm the user. Also, too many buttons might make the user feel insecure about what to do next.\n\n### Spacing in Button groups\n\nNo matter if Buttons are placed side by side or on top of each other, you should keep a minimum spacing of 16 px inbetween.\n\n![Spacing in vertical and horizontal Button groups](./assets/patterns-buttons-groups-spacing.png)\n\n---",

However, we recommend that you only use this variant in cases where the user requires additional information. The standard variant will be used on a monochrome background, whereas the highlight variant should be used on a polychrome background (e.g. on images) for better comprehensibility and accessibility. |\n\n# Icon alignment & stretch\n\nTo enable wider usage order and stretch are customizable.

This is highly recommended whenever you want to convey important information.\n- Neutral Contrast Low is not accessibility-safe and, therefore, recommended to be used only for displaying \"nice to have\" or merely decorative elements that are not crucial for information perception. \n\n### Information level\n\nIn order to define the colors to be used within the screen the **information level** of the respective elements is crucial. \n\n- Play with darker/lighter grey shades to make an element stand out from the background or to set emphasize on it. \n- For large screen space make sure to only use the dedicated surface color for your theme (e.g. Surface). \n- Use the brand color only for highlighting single elements.\n\n### Mixing themes\nWithin certain limits it's allowed to mix the Porsche color themes. For example you could integrate a limited Dark Theme area in your Light Theme\nto visually distinguish it from the rest of the content. **Always make sure that the vast majority of the screen consists of the initially chosen theme.**\nThe color proportion scales for each theme might be a little helper in doing so.\n\n### Color usage\nAll colors must always be used in 100% opacity.\n\n### Focus\nThe `:focus` state helps you to navigate through all interactive elements via tab key. \nBy default, the focused element has a 1px solid outline with a 1px offset, respectively 2px offset for components that come with a background-color or border. \nThe color for the outline is defined by the currentColor value, which refers to the element's color. \nFor example, a primary button will have a 1px solid brand color red outline with 2px offset as `:focus`. \nAdditionally, the input controls which also reflect their validation state color.\n\n---",

    "content": "Color appearance\n\nDividers should generally **only be used in neutral colors**. Depending on the purpose the Porsche Design System provides three neutral scales for both Light and Dark Theme. Prefererably they should be used only on the themes' background colors (Background or Surface color).\n\n#### Neutral Contrast Low\nThis subtle color version **should be used only for \"nice to have\" and merely decorative dividers** that have no immediate effect on the user's perception of the page content as the color \"Neutral Contrast Low\" is not accessibility-safe for neither Light nor Dark Theme. Or in other words: You can use a divider in Neutral Contrast Low whenever the answer to \"Would the user safely find their way around without the divider?\" would definitely be \"Yes\". In these examples the dividers are helpful, but without them the large spacing would do the job of making the separation between the text parts recognizable:\n\n![Example for divider in Neutral Contrast Low](./assets/divider-neutralcontrast-low1.png)  \n  \n\n![Example for divider in Neutral Contrast Low](./assets/divider-neutralcontrast-low2.png)\n\n#### Neutral Contrast Medium / Neutral Contrast High\n\n**Whenever it's crucial for the perception of the page content**, you should go for dividers in Neutral Contrast Medium or Neutral Contrast High. In this example a visual impaired user would hardly be able to recognize the divider as a relevant part for the price calculation if it wouldn't be displayed in a higher contrast color:\n\n![Example for divider in Neutral Contrast Medium](./assets/divider-neutralcontrast-medium.png)\n\n### Layout appearance\n\nThe dividers provided in the Porsche Design System can be used in different visual appearance depending on the layout purpose: \n\n#### Full-bleed divider\n\nFull-bleed dividers **span the entire length of a module or page (\"end to end\")**. Therefore they can be used to separate page sections that require a clear and more distinct visual separation, for example to separate the header from the rest of the web page.\n\n![Full-bleed divider spanning from left to right edge of the web page](./assets/divider-fullbleed.png)\n\n#### Inset divider\n\nInset dividers are **used with an offset that is often generated by preset grid margins, module paddings or by individually defined outer spacings**. They are appropriate for separating related content (like, for example, table rows or a list of contact items) and help users to scan content and perceive it as a related collection. \n\n![Inset dividers with left and right outer spacing](./assets/divider-inset.png)\n\n---",

A heavy use of dividers can lead to visual distraction and crowded interfaces, also taking up too much space especially on mobile screens.\n\n### Don't use dividers only to structure content.\n\n**Dividers are not the only way to create visual rhythm and hierarchy** on a web page. You should always consider other options for structuring content before using dividers, such as: \n\n* White space / spacings (think of general perception rules like the law of proximity)\n* Sizings\n* Color (e.g. emphasizing content by using lighter or darker colors)\n\nAlso sometimes the elements on a page already create a visual structure on their own (like an image grid, for example) and there might be no need for using extra separating elements like dividers.\n\n### Keep decorative use to a minimum.\n\nDividers **should always be used to structure and therefore help the user perceiving the content** of a web page.

    "content": "Use the grid purposefully\n\nAll content elements that should behave responsively should be placed horizontally within the grid, always starting in a column. The spacing between content elements is therefore defined by the grid gutter. \nIn most cases, this should refer to modules or content boxes, while smaller spaces on a more or less \"micro-level\" (both vertical and horizontal) should be defined by using the [Spacing](components/spacing) component.\n\n![Porsche Design System grid alignment](./assets/grid-alignment.png)\n\n### Use the given possibilites wisely\n\nWhen it comes to designing a component or module responsively, there are several screws that can be turned to adapt to different screen sizes, such as changing:\n\n- the component’s grid column width and, therefore, its wrapping behaviour. Example: A 3-column text on desktop, each column using 4 grid columns, can be stacked on mobile using 12 grid columns.\n- text sizes – commonly using smaller text on mobile, larger text on bigger screens.\n- the general layout of the component by using different patterns on mobile and desktop. Example: Turning a multi-column teaser module on desktop into an accordion on mobile.\n\nWhen designing responsive layouts, always aim to find the solution that works best for the specific case, keeping the user and the specific use context in mind.\n\n![Porsche Design System grid behaviour](./assets/grid-behaviour.png)\n\n### Don’t be afraid to think outside of the box\n\nIt is possible to place elements end-to-end, spanning from left to the right edge of the screen. This can be done by using the \"fluid\" content width variant of the [Content Wrapper](components/content-wrapper) component.\nAn example would be a full-width image that generates a more emotional and concise side entry. However, this should be a well-contemplated exception.\n\nAlso, for image groups, it is possible to break out of the grid in order to create a stronger visual coherence. The outer edges (left and right) of the image group should always be placed within the grid, whereas the edges between the single images can be placed exactly in the middle of the gutter.\n\n![End-to-end placement](./assets/grid-endtoend.png)\n",

Or, when setting up a totally new UI design file, feel free to use\nthe [Porsche Design System layout template](https://designsystem.porsche.com/sketch/porsche-design-system-layout-template.sketch) with predefined settings.\n\n### Snap to grid\nMost design apps have the option to snap elements to the grid.\nUsing this feature will help position elements faster in the layout.\n\n### Nudging\nTo make the UI design workflow as smooth as possible, it is helpful to adjust\nthe nudging (= increments an element moves when using keyboard arrows) to the\ngrid steps in use.

    "content": "Translating Sketch spacings into variables \n\nWhen it comes to design-to-dev-handover, we should always keep in mind that the handling of\nspacings is different: Whereas the designer sets the spacings manually in Sketch\nlayouts, the developer implements them by using pre-defined spacing variables\n(e.g. spacing-8 or spacing-16) or the layout variables (e.g. layout-small or layout-medium). Therefore, we should always make sure that the\nspacings in sketch are set as correctly as possible and that they the developer\ncan easily read them in Abstract's inspect mode - of course, a personal\nconversation between designer and developer is always the best way to get\noptimal results.\n\n![Abstract inspect view of spacing](./assets/spacings-inspect.png)\n\n### Borders\nWhile in Sketch the border isn't added to the shape size, browsers\nconsider borders as solid space around elements by default. We recommend to\nignore this fact while designing and to always set the focus on giving the developer\nthe right spacing sizes between or inside elements, even if this results in\nslightly higher elements in implementation due to the additional border.\n\n### Lines\nLines can be created using either a narrow rectangle or a path\nwith a stroke. For better readability of the space between elements, we\nrecommend using paths with a stroke.\n\n### Text boxes\nDevelopers measure the spacing of typography from the bounding box\nof the text element. When working with typography, the bounding box should be\nplaced within the grid parameters, even if the baseline of the typography is not\non the grid line. It's best to always create texts using the text tool, not as a\nbox!\n\n![Text box placement](./assets/spacings-bounding-box.png)\n\n### How to handle uneven image heights\nIt is no rocket science setting the correct 8px spacing values when the element\nheights correspond to the 4px grid themselves. But there is an exception, where\nelement heights don’t fit in perfectly: Images. They can be displayed in many\ndifferent aspect ratios (such as 16:9 or 4:3) and follow various rules for\nhandling responsiveness (like cropping or resizing). Depending on their width\nand the screen size, their height will most likely not fit in the 4px grid. To\nfollow a consistent rule, we recommend to always place the upper part (X/Y\nvalue) on the grid system, even if the bottom part doesn’t fit. The following\nelement underneath should then be placed on the grid line again. As for the\nimplementation of the spacing, the developer should use the spacing variable\nwith the value closest to it. For example, the following design case might lead\nto an implemented spacing value of 16 px, as this the spacing variable the most\nclose to 18 px.\n\n![Image placement](./assets/spacing-images.png)",

If you use the component you have to manually care for the\ncontent to be rendered beneath. To help with this task the component triggers an event called `tabChange` with the index\nof the active tab.\n\nIf you intend to only change content on tab-click without location changes and you are fine that the content needs to be pre-rendered then we prepared a component which also\nhandles the correct display of content according to the active tab.

Sublines must be set in Regular using an \"additional sizes\" class with minimum 16px size.\n\n| Headline size    | Subline size                                      |\n|------------------|-------------------------------------------------  |\n| 16-18 px         | 16 px                                             |\n| 20-42 px         | Min. 2 sizes smaller (see Porsche type scale)     |\n| 44 px or larger  | Min. 4 sizes smaller (see Porsche type scale)     |\n\nExamples:\n\n![Headline-subline combinations](./assets/typography-headline-subline.png)\n\n### Headline\n\nThe headline styles span from large title, that can be used optionally and only once per page, to headlines 1 to 5 that can be used multiple times.\nIn the exceptional case that the headline 1 to 5 does not meet the requirements, there is the possibility to generate a new size. Observe the correct line height and the semibold typeface.\n\n### Weights\n\nThe Porsche Next is available in different font weights that enable to add emphasis and create a visual content hierarchy.\nFor digital applications, we recommend only to use semibold, regular and thin:\n\n- **Porsche Next Semibold** for first-level headlines.\n- **Porsche Next Bold** for copytext highlights.\n- **Porsche Next Regular** for copytext, stand-alone text or sublines (in combination with first-level headlines).\n- **Porsche Next Thin** for stand-alone text larger than 20px.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n### Alignment\n\nPer default, the Porsche Next is always used left-aligned. In individual cases or certain components it can also be used centered,\nbut keep in mind to not exceed 3 text lines, as it is much harder to read. Right-aligned text is also possible in exceptional\ncases, for example in tables where right-aligned numbers should support readability.\n\nPlease avoid…\n\n- … using the font in block typesetting, as this does not correspond with the high-quality brand image.\n- … mixing up different text alignments within one paragraph. Keep it straight and simple.\n\n### Line length\n\nThe longer a text line gets, the harder it is for the user to jump from the end of the current line to the beginning of the next line. Therefore we should always aim at a line length that supports good readability.\n\nFor UI applications it is recommended to use [no more than 80 characters or glyphs per line](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/visual-audio-contrast-visual-presentation.html). This might differ a bit depending on the respective line height and viewport size and results in different pixel widths depending on the Porsche type class in use:\n\n- Copytext X-Small (12 px): max. 400-450 px\n- Copytext Small (16 px): max. 500-550 px\n- Headlines and additional sizes (20-84 px): max. 700 up to max. 2700 px\n\n\n### Multi-column text\n\nGenerally, text paragraphs should be set as single column. Multi-column text should never exceed 3 columns and is only allowed when it can be ensured that all text columns are in the visible viewport range (\"above the fold\"). The user should not have to scroll before being able\nto read the full content.\n\n### Paragraph spacing\n\nThe vertical spacing between copytext paragraphs should be at least 24px, which equals the space of one line of text in-between.\n\n![Copytext paragraph spacing](./assets/typography-paragraph-spacing.png)\n\n\n### Upper case\nThe usage of upper case text is possible, but should be handled with care, as upper case text is always a matter of readability.\nUpper case text should only be used for:\n\n- Exceptional, one-of-a-kind design cases like standing-out parts of a (graphical) composition or in sole design elements like a tag cloud.\n- Special components for which readability is generally not critical (such as short tags).\n- Proper names such as GTS or BOSE.\n\n![Example for uppercase text](./assets/typography-uppercase.png)\n\n\n---",

    "content": "Porsche decided to **end the support for Microsoft Internet Explorer 11 and EdgeHTML**.\n\nThe **Porsche Design System v1.x** is the last major version to support Microsoft Internet Explorer 11 and EdgeHTML. New features introduced starting with the Porsche Design System v2.x are only compatible and tested with the listed browsers and only bugs specific to them will be fixed.\n\n### Why do we stop the support?\n\nTo empower the opportunities of modern web standards including our technical foundation of using web components (Custom Elements, Shadow DOM, CSS Variables), and to deliver the best possible user experience, performance and stability. Also, the share of IE11 and EdgeHTML users is the significant minority of our total users. Thus, we don't want to impair the experience for the vast majority.\n\nIn 2015 Microsoft released Edge to supersede Internet Explorer, pre-installed on Windows 10 and also [recommended by Microsoft to be used as default browser](https://docs.microsoft.com/de-de/lifecycle/faq/internet-explorer-microsoft-edge). Since 2020 the new Microsoft Edge versions are based on Chromium, available for all operating systems. Thus, both IE11 and Microsoft Edge 18 are outdated browsers.\n\n### Can users still access our applications?\n\nWindows, macOS, iOS and Android have at least one supported browser pre-installed. In most cases continuously or at least frequently updated to the latest version. If a user runs into problems using your site with a not-supported browser, they can easily open it with a different browser.\n\n**In order to guide the users and avoid dead-ends, we created an easy-to-use Browser Notification snippet, that should be implemented in all applications using the Porsche Design System.**\n\n### Browser Notification\n\nTo help inform the user about the **end of support of Microsoft Internet Explorer 11 and EdgeHTML** we provide a **Browser Notification Banner** and **Overlay** in form of a npm package `@porsche-design-system/browser-notification`.\n\n#### Install\n\nIt's necessary to have access to the Porsche Design System private npm registry to be able to install the `@porsche-design-system/browser-notification` npm package. If you don't have an account yet, please first [read more about getting started as developer](start-coding/introduction).\n\n\n\n#### Usage\n\nWe provide two notifications variants to show the user the corresponding information in regard to its used browser.\n\nInclude the **Browser Notification** into your project by importing and calling the provided `includeBanner()` or `includeOverlay()` function within your `index.html` just before the closing `</body>` tag (requires a bundler like Webpack, Rollup or a small Node JS script). This adds a `<script>` tag with pre-defined browser- and feature detection pointing to the corresponding browser notification JS snippet hosted on a CDN.\n\n##### Banner notification\n\nThe **Banner** variant is meant to inform the user if they access the application with a browser which doesn't get full support by the application. The banner is placed above the page and can be closed by the user.\n\nIntegration through `includeBanner()` partial.\n\n| Browser Detection           | Initialized |\n| --------------------------- | ----------- |\n| **MS Edge(HTML) <= 18**     | ✓           |\n| **IE <= 11**                | ✓           |\n| **Microsoft Edge Chromium** | ✗           |\n\n##### Overlay notification\n\nThe **Overlay** variant is meant to inform the user when they access the application if their browser doesn't support **custom elements** \nor browser technologies like [**IntersectionObserver**](https://caniuse.com/?search=intersectionobserver) and [**MutationObserver**](https://caniuse.com/?search=mutationobserver) which are required to render the Porsche Design System components. \nThe overlay is placed above the page, covers it completely and can't be closed or removed by the user.\n\nIntegration through `includeOverlay()` partial.\n\n| Feature Detection                                                                               | Initialized |\n| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------| ----------- |\n| **Custom elements != true**                                                                     | ✓           |\n| **IntersectionObserver != true**                                                                | ✓           |\n| **MutationObserver != true**                                                                    | ✓           |\n| **Custom elements && IntersectionObserver && MutationObserver**                                 | ✗           |\n\n##### React / Vue JS\n\n\n\n##### Angular / Vanilla JS\n\n\n\n#### Translations\n\nAutomatic translations for the following languages are provided:  \n`'de' | 'ru' | 'fr' | 'en' | 'it' | 'pt' | 'es' | 'ja' | 'ko' | 'zh' | 'nl' | 'pl' | 'cs' | 'da' | 'et' | 'fi' | 'lt' | 'lv' | 'no' | 'sl' | 'sv' | 'tr' | 'uk'`\n\nThe **Browser Notification** is looking once as soon as the script initializes for the obligatory `lang` attribute defined in the `html` tag. Support is given for the following formats, e.g.:\n\n- `lang=\"en\"`\n- `lang=\"en_US\"`\n- `lang=\"en-US\"`\n\nIf none of these languages can be found, it will fall back to `en`.\n\n#### Troubleshooting\n\nThere always might be a case where something goes wrong. Here are some possible answers:\n\n1. **Q:** Why does the translation not get recognized automatically?  \n   **A:** Mostly this is a result of false order of script loading and setting translation key by the application. It's required that the `lang` attribute in the `html` tag is defined with the correct value before the **Browser Notification** script gets initialized.  \n   **A:** The translation key is not part of the provided keys (see \"Translations\")  \n   **A:** The translation key has not the correct format (see \"Translations\")\n2. **Q:** Why are there no implementation guidelines for my JS framework?  \n   **A:** Implementing a third party script can be done in many ways regarding the setup of your application. So there isn't a solely true way to integrate it in a specific framework. Just one rule of thumb: **It should be initialized as late as possible.**\n",

    "content": "To improve the support of accessibility in general, start by observing worldwide regulations (W3C), as individual countries tend to base their regulations on global agreements. \nTherefore the [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.0 AA](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/) are a good starting point which can be augmented by [Article 9 on Accessibility](https://www.un.org/development/desa/disabilities/convention-on-the-rights-of-persons-with-disabilities/article-9-accessibility.html) from the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD).\n\nBut as you might see, all these guidelines have one pitfall: they are very hard to read and difficult to interpret. Therefore we have developed a stepwise accessibility workflow which is the **most effective way to maximize compliance** and should help designers and developers to implement and support Web Accessibility in their applications.\n\n\n\n**But always keep in mind:** Accessibility is not the fulfilment of a fixed ruleset or following a bunch of technical requirements. Instead, it's more about a mindset which should be a fixed part at the beginning of a project and face every possible aspect like strategy, conception, ux, ui, design, development, performance, etc. \n\n--- \n\n### Further information\n* [The ADA Book](https://adabook.com/)\n* [Website Accessibility & the Law: Why Your Website Must Be Compliant](https://www.searchenginejournal.com/website-accessibility-law/285199)\n* [The International Accessibility Standards You Need to Follow](https://www.telerik.com/blogs/the-international-accessibility-standards-you-need-to-follow)\n* [THE EU Web Accessibility Directive](https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/web-accessibility)\n* [Countries that Have Adopted WCAG Standards](https://www.3playmedia.com/2017/08/22/countries-that-have-adopted-wcag-standards-map/)\n",

    "content": "A typical form in Porsche web applications is made up of five basic elements:\n\n1. **The general structure**  \n  … is defined by how the form is being layed out within the specific page, involving column layout, logical sections as well as proper spacings helping the user to capture the form at first sight.  \n  \n2. **Form fields**  \n  … provide all input options the user needs to fill out the form, whether it's commonly used free-form text input (Text Fields, Text Areas) or specific data inputs (such as Checkboxes, Radio Buttons, Select). They can have different states and variants that are described in the specific component guidelines.  \n  \n3. **Labels**  \n  … accompany the form fields, helping the user to understand the type of input that is required. They should always be short and descriptive (optimal: 1-3 words), stating the required input. Always start labels capitalized. In all Porsche Design System components, labels are placed top-aligned to support scannability and speed up form completion.  \n  \n4. **Good feedback**  \n  … is crucial to give the user both a feeling of success when completing the form fields correctly as well as providing valuable support in case of wrong entry.  \n  \n5. **Call-to-actions**  \n  … are needed to initiate further processing, for example submitting, sending or cancelling a form input. Most forms come with two call-to-actions. The successive (and therefore most important) button should be emphasized. As red is a very sensitive color in forms (due to error notifications) we highly recommend to go for a [Secondary Button](components/button) in grey, accompanied by a Tertiary Button for the cancelling / least important option. Button labels have an effect on the conversion rate and should always be short and descriptive, informing the user about what to expect. Something like \"submit\" is not clear enough. Good examples are \"Get a free demo\", \"Create account\" or \"Subscribe now\".  \n\n  \n ![The five basic elements of Porsche forms](../../../assets/patterns-forms-dna.png)\n\n---",

    "content": "Follow these basic tips to design forms for Porsche web applications that make users happy:\n\n### Go for relevance\n\n**Only ask for information that is really needed from the user.**  \n  Not only will the user be more likely to fill out the form, but you also preserve the user from the cognitive load (especially on mobile devices). The shorter the form, the better the completion time – and the better the conversion rate.  \n\n**Start with fields that are easy to fill in.**  \n  Keep the hurdle for the user low to fill out the complete form by providing easy-to-fill-out fields first. Good example: Start with name and e-mail before asking for the credit card number.  \n\n**Pre-fill or auto-detect as much as possible.**  \n  We already know some information about the user, like name, country or e-mail address, for example? Perfect! Pre-fill the form with this information in order to make it easier for the user to fill in the form.\n\n### Your form should be intuitive\n\n**Keep the form in a logical, intuitive order.**  \nFor example first name prior to the last name. Don't forget to take international formatting into account, as the order of form fields is often market-dependent.  \n\n**Auto-focus the first field (or the needed one) by default.**  \nThis allows users to step in quickly and tab through the form elements in a logical way. The form elements provided in the Porsche Design System are already equipped with an on-board focus state.  \n  \n**Provide the correct input type.**  \nIn the best case, the correct input format (for example e-mail address, URL, phone number) should be technically preset to make the input easier for the user.  \n\n**Avoid placeholder text.**  \nPlaceholder text tends to be disadvantageous in several respects: Once the form field is in focus or filled in, the placeholder is gone or overwritten and it's hard for the user to remember what the placeholder was all about – in the worst case, the user is forced to delete the input text to re-reveal the placeholder. Also, placeholders make it hard for the user to quickly scan the form and see what fields have already been filled out. When you want to give the user some information about the input format, go for information text outside the form field instead ([Nielsen Norman Group, 2014](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/form-design-placeholders/)).  \n\n**Explain all options for action to the user.**  \nThe user should always be aware of all possibilities. Therefore, form fields that are not touch- or clickable (yet) should be clearly distinguishable from active form fields. Go for disabled form states when needed which you will find in the Porsche Design System form components.\n\n### Support scannability\n\nYou should make it easy as possible for the user to perceive a form quickly:\n\n**Avoid visual hurdles.**   \nThe more fluid a form is perceived, the better the conversion rate. \"From our research studies, we've learned that even the slightest moment of hesitation when completing a form can significantly hurt the form’s response rate (that is, the number of people who complete the form).\" ([Nielsen Norman Group, 2013](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/form-design-white-space/)).  \n\n**Work with spacings.**  \nCluster the form in logical, coherent parts (see \"Form layout\" below).  \n\n**Split long processes.**  \nGo for multi-step forms in case of a long process (see below) in order to prevent cognitive overload – forms should always be kept manageable for the user**.**\nAlways provide a progress bar (% or the number of steps) to give the user a hint on what’s already finished.\n\n### Provide help\n\n**… only when help is truly required!**  \nOtherwise, the user might feel overwhelmed or, in the worst case, patronized. \n \n**Always provide status information.**  \nGive the user a hint on the progress state, success or error states or the completion of a form. \n \n**Provide extra information, when needed.**  \nSometimes it's helpful for the user to get further information, for example on the input format or on why the information is needed. It depends on the length and quality of the information on how it should be displayed:\n\n* **Short and/or very important information** that's essential for the completion of the form should be displayed directly outside the form field, so that users are not forced to make further clicks. At Porsche, we always place description text on top of the form fields (as the bottom space is reserved for validation messages) in Copytext x-small in order to distinguish it from label text. You'll find detailed information on the correct placement of the description text in the specific form component guidelines.  \n    \n  ![Information displayed outside the form field](../../../assets/patterns-forms-helptext-open.png)  \n\n* **Longer and/or less important information** (even more so if it's optional to read) should be hidden in an \"information\" icon that is placed directly (spacing 4 px) after the field label and reveals an explanation in a tooltip on hover (desktop) or on click (tablet/mobile). As soon as the user continues filling out the form, the tooltip should disappear. This way, we keep the form short and prevent the user from extra scrolling. But be aware to use tooltips sparingly.  \n    \n  ![Information displayed in tooltip](../../../assets/patterns-forms-helptext-tooltip.png)\n\n### Handle with care: Sensitive and personal data\n\nMany users are afraid of spam or hackers and especially do not like to enter their personal data in forms. In order to prevent users from cancelling their form input:  \n  \n\n**Ask for as little information as possible.**  \nUsers shouldn't get the feeling that they are being asked for irrelevant or unnecessary information or even that information is only collected for the purpose of data collection.  \n\n**Give deeper information on a specific input.**  \nSometimes it's helpful to give some more information on the \"why\" of a required input, in order to remove any doubt from the user, even more, when it comes to very specific data the user is not used to fill in or when the further processing of information is not clear enough. In this case, a tooltip with an \"information\" icon (right behind the input label) is the best way to go.\n\n  ![Tooltip information on personal data input](../../../assets/patterns-forms-personal-data.png)\n  \n**Respect GDPR and other legal regulations.**  \nThe user should be asked to enter only information that is absolutely necessary.\n\n---",

    "content": "Example of the anatomy of a form\n\n1. **Headline and subline**  \n   A clear title gives the user some information on what to expect when filling out the form.  \n   \n2. **Sections including form elements**  \n   The longer a form, the more crucial it is to split it into content-related sub-areas in order to increase scannability.  \n   Thus form fields that require similar information should be grouped together to create a logical order. This can be set as a coding property \"fieldset\". \n   Each fieldset should be initiated by a title that gives the user short information on what data is required in this section.\n   \n   | Viewport | Range                  | Headline    | Subline     | Section Headline | Section    |\n   | -------- | ---------------------- | ----------- | ----------- | ---------------- | ---------- |\n   | **XS-S** | 320-999 px             | Headline  1 | Text Small  | Headline 4       | Headline 5 |\n   | **M-XL** | 1000-1760 px or larger | Headline  1 | Text Medium | Headline 4       | Headline 5 |\n\n\n3. **Call-to-actions**  \n   Call-to-actions are needed to submit or cancel the form input and should always be placed left-aligned.\n   \n\n### Single-column layout\n\nEven though today's displays offer a lot of space: **Good forms are always single-column!** This is even more important when it comes to mobile view or longer forms, especially multi-step forms. A research study revealed that single-column forms could be completed 15.4 sec faster than a comparable multi-column form and at a 95% confidence level ([CXL Institute, 2018](https://cxl.com/research-study/form-field-usability/)).  \n\nThis is why:\n\n- Single-column forms make it easier for the user to scan a form fluently and with less distraction.\n- The common reading direction is zigzag (\"Z\"). This makes it harder to perceive a multi-column form.\n\n### Form layout spacings\n\nAccording to the [\"law of proximity\" in Gestalt psychology](https://lawsofux.com/law-of-proximity) objects that are near or proximate to each other tend to be grouped together. So in order to make it easy for the user to scan the form you should cluster the form in logical, coherent parts by working with spacings. We differ the following spacings (according to the **Porsche Design System spacing system**): \nDepending on the viewport you're designing for you should stick to slightly different spacings for your form:\n\n| Viewport | Range             | Total max. width of the form | Min. form top / bottom spacing (A) | Section spacing (B) | Min. vertical/horizontal form field spacing (C) |\n| -------- | ----------------- | ---------------------------- | ---------------------------------- | ------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |\n| **XS**   | 320-759 px        | 12 grid columns              | 48/64 px                           | 40 px               | 16 px                                           |\n| **S**    | 760-999 px        | 10 grid columns              | 48/64 px                           | 40 px               | 16 px                                           |\n| **M**    | 1000-1299 px      | 8 grid columns               | 64/80 px                           | 48 px               | 16 px                                           |\n| **L**    | 1300-1759 px      | 6 grid columns               | 64/80 px                           | 48 px               | 16 px                                           |\n| **XL**   | 1760 px or larger | 6 grid columns               | 64/80 px                           | 48 px               | 16 px                                           |\n\nAs for the smallest grouped element within a form – label and form field – we recommend using 4 px spacing. This is also predefined in the Porsche Design System form elements.\n  \n![Form layout with spacings](../../../assets/patterns-forms-anatomy-mobile-spacings.png)\n\n\n### Form field widths \n\nIt's commonly recommended to set the form field width to the estimated length of the required input. As we design for international markets at Porsche it's often quite hard to predict the estimated length depending on the language. Also, this might lead to a quite unbalanced and \"fluttering\" look and feel of the form in general. \nThus, we recommend to go the \"golden middle way\" in order to cover both the reflection of the intended content length, but also visual pleasure:\n\n**Form fields should be set to full form width (100 %) by default** to keep the fluttering effect low.\nHowever, we recommend to break out of that rule and **go for estimated form field lengths in the following cases** (even if this doesn't mean 100 % in total for that row) as this supports the user's perception:\n\n- When setting form elements in a row (one or more) that _aren't_ Text Fields, for example Selects or Radio Button Groups.\n- When setting multiple form fields in a row (only when it makes sense, e.g. in case of ZIP code and city input).\n- In case of very short forms (up to 3 fields).\n\n### Form Grid\n\nWhen setting field widths to the estimated length you should stick to the following standard values to support a common overall look and feel for Porsche forms.\nThe % values always refer to the full maximum width of the form (see table above):  \n  \n**25 % / 33.33 % / 50 % / 66.66 % / 75 % / 100 %**\n\n\n![Form field widths](../../../assets/patterns-forms-field-widths.png)\n\n---",

Instead of copy-and-paste-ing the desktop view (as this might lead to problems with readability and perception), optimize your forms on smaller viewports for a mobile-friendly experience and focus especially on the following aspects:\n\n### Provide state information\n\nSet the visual focus to the current form field to give orientation and enable the user to perceive information quickly. Also, you should always give the user information about the **current progress status** by providing a progress bar (% or \"step 1 of 3\"). This is not only relevant for longer or multi-step forms in general, but especially on mobile viewports, where the user has no clear overview of the length of the complete form. \n\n### Use native components\n\nUsers are familiar with device-specific UI patterns (for example the iOS date picker). So the first choice for a good mobile UX should be to go for native elements instead of individual UI patterns.\n\n![iPhone screen with native date picker](../../../assets/patterns-forms-native-date-picker.png)\n\n### Provide correct input types\n\nWhenever possible, the required input type should be technically preset, so that users are provided automatically with the correct UI controls. This helps fill out the form much faster.\n\n### Automate actions (when possible)\n\nMake it easy for users by providing autocorrect (meaning the form automatically corrects e.g. spelling errors) and autocomplete (specific fields are automatically completed such as filling in the user's ZIP code based on the location).\n\n### Use input contraints\n\nWhen it makes sense you should set input constraints to your Text Fields and Textareas to limit the input length, as some users tend to over-explain and therefore spend much time filling out the form, which might lead to frustrating and bad ratings in the end.\n\n---\n\n# Form validation\n\nGood forms provide **valuable support** – both **for success**, when the user completes form fields correctly, and **for error cases**, when the user makes a wrong entry. However, there's a direct correlation between *how* and *when* users are presented with form validation errors and the pace and effort with which they are able to resolve them.\n\n\n![Form layouts with error and success notification](../../../assets/patterns-forms-validation.png)\n\n_Example input field with error | 1. Asterisk, 2. Border highlight, 3. Error message_\n\n\n### Client-side validation\n\n**In the best case, you should always give direct feedback**. This is why we recommend validating the user’s data before submitting the form (called client-side validation). This type of inline validation should be done at the moment after the input field is out of focus. This will help quickly identify the elements that need to be corrected and help users get through forms better and faster.\n\n**Common reasons for errors**\n\n- input incorrectly formatting data\n- leaving a mandatory field blank\n- leaving a mandatory field incomplete\n\n**Form validation guideline**\n\n- **Mark required fields.** Our tests (optional vs. required with an asterisk) showed that mark required fields with an red asterisk is an easy way to improve the usability of forms.\n\n- **Display of the error message.** Inline validation feedback should always be displayed in the direct context of the action, ideally below the respective form field \n\n- **Validate input fields directly.** Validation should happen at the moment after the input field is out of focus.\n\n- **Scroll to first error.** When the user tries to send a form that includes an error, the user should automatically be scroll to the first error field and set the focus on the input.\n\n- **Error summary.** Additional to the error message beneath the input fields, you can include an error summary at the top of the form to summarise the mistakes a user has made.\nIt might also make sense if you don't want to show which field has an error, f.e. login or have a required group of fields rather than a specific one.\n\n- **Radio Button and Checkbox group.** To avoid providing each Radio Button and each Checkbox with its own error message within a group, we recommend marking the fieldset required. The error message will then be displayed for the entire group at the last item.\n\n![Form validation within a group](../../../assets/validation-fieldset.png)\n\n---\n\n# Error messages\n\n### Tonality and content\n\nError messages explain clearly and simply what the problem is. Avoid the word \"error\" and technical terms or abbreviations.\n\nYou should offer a solution so that users can repeat a step to complete a task or try another route to proceed their action.\n\nKeep in my mind that experiencing an error is frustrating for the user and ask yourself what you can do or say to absorb frustration and improve the experience. For example, with a bit of humor. But don’t go overboard. And do not neglect the clarity within your copy.\n\n**Error messages should be**\n\n- brief\n- written out\n- describe the solution\n- displayed below the form field\n- visible immediately after lost focus\n- removed after successfully corrected input\n\n\n\n**The following questions should be answered to create a good error message**\n1.\tWhat did the user try to do when the error message appeared?\n2.\tWhy was the error message displayed?\n3.\tHow can the user continue and complete the process?\n4.\tIf there is no immediate solution, can we offer the user alternatives? E.g. a search input field or a contact of the support team\n\n---\n\n### **Writing examples** \n\n### Credit card number is incorrect\n\n**Instead of saying**  \n*Invalid input*\n\n**Describe the problem**  \n*Numbers are missing in your credit card number.*\n\n**Offer a solution**  \n*Numbers are missing in your credit card number. Please check your input.*\n\n**Add a human touch**  \n*Is the card number complete? Please check your input.*\n\n---\n\n### Mandatory free text input field is not filled\n\n**Instead of saying**  \n*This field is obligatory.*\n\n**Describe the problem**  \n*Please enter your message.*\n\n**Add a human touch**  \n*What would you like to tell us?*\n\n---\n\n### Server error on website\n\n**Instead of saying**  \nService not available. The server is temporarily busy. Please try again later.\n\n**Describe the problem**  \n*Unfortunately, we can’t load the site because of a problem with our server.*\n\n**Offer a solution**  \n*Unfortunately, we can’t load the site because of a problem with our server. Try again later or visit another site:*\n- Porsche Website\n- My Porsche\n- Porsche Shop\n\n**Add a human touch**  \n*Not our claim to performance.\nUnfortunately, we can’t load the site because of a problem with our server. Try again later or visit another site, while we’re working on a solution:*\n- Porsche Website\n- My Porsche\n- Porsche Shop\n\n---\n### **Prevent errors** \n\nYour microcopy might even help in preventing errors, e.g. by telling a user as clear as possible what format and input is required for a certain input field. E.g. List the necessary characters that a password must contain. \n\n---",

For form design you should consider in particular the following aspects:\n\n* Forms should **provide 100% keyboard navigation**, which means: Users should be able to jump through the whole form using the tab key.\n* Always **provide focus states** to show the user both the starting and when proceeding the current position. The Porsche Design System form components are provided with a focus state on board.\n* **Never use color as a single indicator for a type of use or state**. In form layout, this means that for error or success notifications and for highlighting incorrect form fields it's highly recommended to work with further formatting, e.g. a larger border width. This is also already predefined in the Porsche Design System form components.\n* **Provide a sufficient click/touch area** for each component. [Apple’s Human Interface Guidelines](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/ios/visual-design/adaptivity-and-layout/) suggest providing a tappable area of 44 x 44 px for all controls. As this \"safe zone\" might result in large spacings between components (just think of a stacked checkbox list) or overlapping of the tappable areas, we'd recommend defining the tappable area component-based, as the size of the tappable area is also a matter of the general height *and* width of a component. You'll find detailed information in the respective component guidelines.\n\n---",

The only extra CSS you need is a `margin-top` for the subline. \nYou have to add your own class based spacing system to your project because it is not bundled with the Porsche Design System.\n\n<Playground>\n  <p-grid class=\"form-top-spacing\">\n    <p-grid-item size=\"{ base: 12, m: 8 }\">\n      \n      \n    </p-grid-item>\n  </p-grid>\n</Playground>\n\n### Form body\n\nThe form body is mainly a mix out of basic `grid` and `flex` components in addition with some CSS classes to provide the horizontal and vertical form grid spacings.  \nBelow you can find the explanations of the used class names.\n\n<Playground>\n  <p-grid class=\"form-section-spacing\">\n    <p-grid-item size=\"{ base: 12, s: 10, m: 8, l: 6 }\">\n      <form novalidate>\n        <p-fieldset-wrapper label=\"Form legend text\">\n          <p-flex direction=\"{base: 'column', m: 'row'}\" class=\"form-grid-item-container\">\n            <p-flex-item class=\"form-grid-item\" width=\"{base: 'full', m: 'one-quarter'}\">\n              \n            </p-flex-item>\n            <p-flex-item class=\"form-row-spacing form-row-spacing--zero-m form-grid-item\" width=\"{base: 'full', m: 'one-quarter'}\">\n              \n            </p-flex-item>\n            <p-flex-item class=\"form-row-spacing form-row-spacing--zero-m form-grid-item\" width=\"{base: 'full', m: 'one-quarter'}\">\n              \n            </p-flex-item>\n            <p-flex-item class=\"form-row-spacing form-row-spacing--zero-m form-grid-item\" width=\"{base: 'full', m: 'one-quarter'}\">\n              \n            </p-flex-item>\n          </p-flex>\n          <p-flex direction=\"{base: 'column', m: 'row'}\" class=\"form-row-spacing form-grid-item-container\">\n            <p-flex-item class=\"form-grid-item\" width=\"{base: 'full', m: 'one-third'}\">\n              \n            </p-flex-item>\n            <p-flex-item class=\"form-row-spacing form-row-spacing--zero-m form-grid-item\" width=\"{base: 'full', m: 'one-third'}\">\n              \n            </p-flex-item>\n            <p-flex-item class=\"form-row-spacing form-row-spacing--zero-m form-grid-item\" width=\"{base: 'full', m: 'one-third'}\">\n              \n            </p-flex-item>\n          </p-flex>\n          <p-flex direction=\"{base: 'column', m: 'row'}\" class=\"form-row-spacing form-grid-item-container\">\n            <p-flex-item class=\"form-grid-item\" width=\"{base: 'full', m: 'half'}\">\n              \n            </p-flex-item>\n            <p-flex-item class=\"form-row-spacing form-row-spacing--zero-m form-grid-item\" width=\"{base: 'full', m: 'half'}\">\n              \n            </p-flex-item>\n          </p-flex>\n          \n        </p-fieldset-wrapper>\n        <p-button-group class=\"form-section-spacing form-bottom-spacing\">\n          \n          \n        </p-button-group>       \n      </form>\n    </p-grid-item>\n  </p-grid>\n</Playground>\n\n### Explanation of used class names\n\nHere you can find the **SCSS** of the used class names. This is meant to be just **one** possible solution to build the form grid. \nIt's totally up to you and your team how to achieve the form grid described in the [design guidelines](patterns/forms/guidelines).\n\nSetting the responsive widths of the flex-items should always be in context to the specific form and application environment.\n\n#### Top spacing\n\nTop spacing defines the larger between the beginning of the form and the top of the page or section.\n\n \n\n#### Bottom spacing\n\nBottom spacing defines the larger between the end of the form and the bottom of the page or section.\n\n \n\n#### Section and fieldset spacing\n\nThis slightly larger spacing is used to separate form sections or fieldsets from each other.\n\n \n\n#### Row spacing\n\nRow spacing is used to add a small spacing between form rows. This should be responsive to support the switch between rows and columns regarding of specific breakpoints.\n\n \n\n### Grid spacings\n\nThe horizontal form grid spacings of the grid-container and the grid-item.\n\n",

    "content": "We also have the responsibility to sign the consent form (Declaration of consent) in accordance with the EU data protection basic regulation (DSGVO) by using design guidelines and implement measures in such a way that consent is given by the user voluntarily. Studies show that especially when the user does not feel that they have control over their data or that the disclosure would have (or may cause) negative consequences they won’t share their data. Therefore, not only the benefits of data disclosure should be transparent to the user (for example the sending of an advertising brochure), but also the exclusion of possible risks (for example, that data will not be passed on to third parties for undefined purposes) and give a feeling of control.\n\nIn principle, it is helpful for a successful implementation of the maxims to be oriented towards the function of the purpose statement: The purpose must allow users to understand the consequences of data sharing and handling for them. A successful implementation of the maxims therefore enables the users to effectively control the consequences indicated by the purposes.\nIn the section **Handle with care: Sensitive and personal data** we already mentioned some guidelines about handling personal data. In this section we will give you a little more insights about all of the Privacy Principles. \n\n\n**The Privacy UX Design Guidelines Principles are:**\n\n1. **Limitation**\n   A dialogue may only collect the data required for the specified purpose. Which and how much personal data may be collected therefore depends on how concrete (or how general) the purposes were expressed. If, for example, a data processor needs to know whether the user is already of age in order to release a service, this only requires the user to indicate the age of majority, but not the specific age.\n\n2. **Selection and control**\n    The users must always be able to give (or refuse) their consent for each individual purpose. In doing so, they must actively decide to save data for a clearly defined purposes (so-called opt-in). The users must therefore take active steps to give their declaration of consent, for example by clicking a checkbox or toggling an online form. On the other hand, a ticked box does not require any active action by the users and does not provide a valid declaration of consent in the general view. If the data collection is to be based on the user's declaration of consent (and not another legal basis), the user must therefore expressly have agreed to this before the data may be collected. Because users evaluate the sensitivity of their data differently, they should always be given as much choice as possible (for example, how to contact the users).\n\n3. **Explanation**\n    Can the user understand why which data is collected? Textual and/or graphic explanatory guides can be used for this purpose. In addition, added value should also be presented visually whenever possible. Putting things into context (explained in the next section) is another important strategy to make the collection of data \"meaningful\" for the user. At the very best, the user can also be informed about the extent to which the disadvantages feared by him with the data disclosure are already excluded, reduced or at least controlled by the data processor (i.e. the Porsche AG) due to the protective measures provided. Measures are, for example, the pseudonymisation of personal data, their encryption as well as technical-organizational access controls.\n\n4. **Contextualisation of the consent**\n    Consent should preferably be obtained \"just in time\", i.e. at the time when it is necessary (but no later than at the time of collection of the data or at the time when data is processed for a different purpose than previously indicated). The justification for collecting and obtaining consent, both in terms of time, space and logic, should be sent directly and without interruption to be tied to each other.\n\n5. **Controllability**\n    Dialogs should be controllable in order to make the flow of processes transparent for the user (for example, when entering data). There should be no dependencies and couplings between providing data or the booking of services. Instead, it should be possible to agree to each processing purpose individually. Users should be able to manipulate, terminate and resume processes at any time, even retroactively. An attractive controllability is especially important for mobile devices. For this purpose, the user must be provided with sufficient information for orientation and navigation. This also refers to accurate, friendly, and complete feedback in case of unexpected behavior or errors.\n\n6. **Support**\n    Filling in fields or forms should always be supported as much as possible. This includes responsive design, error tolerances, auto-completion, search function (for example for dropdowns), logical (alphabetical) sorting, the use of common formats for for example date entries. Relationships can also exist across fields.\n\n7. **Minimalism and continuity**\n    Dialogues and processes should have a clear overall structure and clearly distinguish individual topics or contents to separate them from each other. Visual and informational overload must be avoided. This prevents the user from being overwhelmed and gives a feeling of familiarity and security.\n\n8. **Appreciation**\n    The consideration of correct salutations, titles and names, if necessary, is an element that creates trust and closeness. Individuality should be respected (for example no pressure to choose 'man' or 'woman' in a form field for gender selection).  This also includes the possibility for the user to specify titles (for example Prof. Dr.).\n\n9. **User testing**\n    These principles describe possible implementations of the consent form, which should enable the user to effectively control the consequences or risks associated with the disclosure of data. In order to ensure a successful implementation, this must be contextualised (i.e. tested empirically with users using the respective touchpoint). This does not only mean technical functional tests.  Rather, it must be checked whether the concrete implementation of the principles really leads to the users' understanding of the consequences and risks of data disclosure and feel that they can be effectively controlled.",

One for China and one for RoW (rest of world).\n\n### Example (index.html)\n\n\nAlso, the function `getFontFaceStylesheet()` of the `@porsche-design-system/components-{js|angular|react}/partials` packages was extended with the option `{ cdn: 'auto' | 'cn' }` to force loading the font-face style definitions from Chinese CDN only, e.g.:\n\n",
