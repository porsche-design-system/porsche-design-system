To answer the most frequently asked questions the following list is constantly updated. Please read through before using
the support and communication channels for questions. **Still missing anything? [We are happy to hear from you!](/help/support)**

## Who develops the Porsche Design System?

The Porsche Design System is developed and maintained centrally by a designated team from Porsche Digital GmbH in Germany
and is under the responsibility of Dr. Ing. h.c. F. Porsche AG. In an open community, everyone is encouraged to participate
and contribute to the Porsche Design System and give feedback at any time.

## How can I get in contact with the Porsche Design System team?

We want to enable continuous communication within the community. Therefore we offer different use-case-related
communication channels to get in contact or ask for support or submit support requests. You can find all of them
[in the support section](/help/support).

## How can I access the Porsche Design System files?

**Developer**
The source code of the Porsche Design System is stored and developed within a public GitHub repository and distributed
via npm packages. For further information, have a look at [Start Developing](/developing/introduction).

**Designer**
There is a Figma and a UXPin library available. For access and more details, have a look at
[Start Designing](/designing/introduction).

## What is the release strategy and how are the issues prioritized?

All versioned releases of the Porsche Design System combine both design and code. All changes are based on the overall
business goals and the actual needs of the teams. The upcoming release content is accessible in the
[quarterly roadmap](/news/roadmap). The roadmap is not a delivery commitment and may be changed based on upcoming needs,
feedback and associated requirements.

## What happens with contents marked as deprecated?

Please take a look at our [versioning and release strategy](/must-know/versioning).

## How often should I update?

As part of professional software development, it's recommended to update the
`@porsche-design-system/components-{js|react|angular|vue}` npm package (like any other npm dependency) on a regular
basis, e.g. every 2 weeks. This is important to get the latest bug fixes, security fixes and performance improvements as
well as ensuring a harmonic visual appearance and user experience across different Porsche applications.

## How to handle older versions?

If you are still running older versions (e.g. `@porsche/ui-kit-core`–`v0`, `@porsche/ui-kit-react`–`v0`,
`@porsche-design-system/components-{js|react|angular}@{v1|v2}`), we highly recommend updating to the latest Porsche
Design System release if possible.

## How do I submit bug reports or feature requests and how are they handled?

Once you find a reproducible bug, you can
[open an issue](https://github.com/porsche-design-system/porsche-design-system/issues/new/choose) or directly submit a
fix as a pull request within the
[public Porsche Design System repository](https://github.com/porsche-design-system/porsche-design-system). We will
address and respond to new bug reports as soon as possible, usually within a few days. Bugs should be fixed within one
sprint depending on current capacity planning. The best approach for urgent bugs is to fix them locally within your
project and submit the fix or create a PR afterwards.
