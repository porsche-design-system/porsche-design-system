Porsche is committed to digital accessibility and aims to ensure that people with disabilities have unrestricted access
to our digital offerings. Our goal is to optimize the user experience for everyone by consistently implementing
applicable accessibility standards.

## Description of Our Service

The Porsche Design System is a collection of design guidelines, components, and tools that help teams create consistent,
user-friendly and accessible digital products. It includes resources for visual design, interaction patterns, and
accessibility standards based on [WCAG 2.2 AA](https://w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag).

## How to Use Our Service in an Accessible Way

Our service offers you a variety of features that support accessibility, including:

- **Keyboard Navigation**: All interactive elements can be accessed and operated using a keyboard.
- **Screen Reader Compatibility**: Our components are designed to be compatible with screen readers, providing
  appropriate ARIA attributes and semantic HTML.
- **Color Contrast**: We ensure sufficient color contrast between text and background to enhance readability for users
  with visual impairments.
- **Responsive Design**: Our components are designed to be responsive, ensuring usability across different devices and
  screen sizes.
- **Focus Management**: We implement proper focus management to ensure that users can navigate through interactive
  elements in a logical order.
- **Customizable Settings**: Users can customize certain aspects of the design system to suit their individual needs,
  such as font size and color schemes.

## Measures to support accessibility

- **Definition of Done**: Accessibility is an integral part of our Definition of Done (DoD) for all components and
  applications developed using the Porsche Design System. This ensures that accessibility is considered from the
  beginning of the development process.
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive documentation is provided to guide developers in implementing accessibility best
  practices when using the design system.
- **Testing**: Our application and components undergo regular testing (automated and manual) to ensure compliance with
  accessibility standards and to identify potential issues.
- **Monitoring**: We continuously monitor and evaluate our digital offerings to ensure they meet accessibility standards
  and user needs.

Through regular reviews and adjustments, we ensure that our digital offerings comply with legal requirements and are
continuously improved to guarantee high accessibility and security for all users.
