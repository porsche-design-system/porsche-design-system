# Browser Compatibility

<TableOfContents headings={[]} />

At Porsche we want the best performance, security and modern feature opportunities for our applications and users.
Therefore we follow the release cycles of the global browser providers and continuously measure our browser & platform
usage share of all Porsche applications
([view data](https://datastudio.google.com/open/1kMBbEg9F79q_QOg2zFtz52I_S85Fy47b)).

To ensure visual and functional compatibility, we do automatic and manual testing for the defined set of browsers and
versions. If a browser is not listed on this page we donâ€™t test it, provide assistance or fix bugs for it.
