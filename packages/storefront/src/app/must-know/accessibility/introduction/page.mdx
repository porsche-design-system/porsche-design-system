## What is digital accessibility

When we say a digital product is **accessible** we mean that its content is available to, and its functionality can be
operated by, literally anyone. For **creators of digital products**, it's frivolous to assume that all users can see and
use a keyboard, mouse or touch screen, and can interact with the page content the same way they do. This can lead to an
experience that works well for those people but **creates issues** which range from simple annoyances to absolute
horrible user experiences.

Accessibility refers to the experience of users who might be outside the narrow scope of the "typical" user, and who
might access or interact with things differently than you expect. Specifically, we are talking about more than **15% of
worldwide users who have some type of impairment or disability**.

For example, although we tend to centre our discussion of accessibility on users with **physical impairments**, we can
all relate to the experience of using an interface that is not accessible to us for other reasons. Have you ever had a
problem using a desktop site on a mobile phone, or seen the message "This content is not available in your area", or
couldn't read a text because the font-size and contrast were too low? Those are all **accessibility issues** we have to
face and find **practical solutions** for.

## Why it matters

As maintainers of the **Porsche Design System**, we always want the **best experience for all users** and provide best
in class solutions for our customers. And this includes **accessibility**. There are several overall benefits to anyone
who uses accessible products:

- **Better user experience** for everyone
- **Better SEO** (Search Engine Optimization)
- **Better performance** (e.g. faster loading times)
- **Better maintainability** (e.g. less code)
- **Better compatibility** (e.g. with assistive technologies)
- **Better brand image** (e.g. more trust)
- **Better business** (e.g. more customers)
- **Better legal compliance** (e.g. avoiding lawsuits)

**By using our components, you get all these benefits for free!** We take care of the **accessibility** on component
level, so you can focus on your business logic.

## Meeting global accessibility standards

At Porsche, we are **driven by excellence**, and the **Porsche Design System** is committed to deliver highly **usable
and accessible** components that are not limited to certain users or use cases. To ensure that our components meet the
official [**WCAG**](https://w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag) **2.2 AA** standards, we follow a set of
**guidelines** and **best practices**:

### Evaluate & research

Before starting development of a new component, we evaluate the **use cases** and **requirements** to ensure that the
component is **usable** and **accessible** for all users. We also research **best practices** and **guidelines** to
ensure that the component is **compliant** with the latest WCAG 2.2 standards.

### Design & develop

During the design & development phase, we follow **inclusive design** guidelines and integrate **accessibility
features** wherever it makes sense (e.g. by respecting official keyboard mappings for UI components). We also ensure
that the component is **usable** with keyboard navigation, screen readers, and other assistive technologies.

### Test & validate

After the component is developed, it runs through a consecutive **testing** and **validation** process:

#### Stage 1: Automated tests

- **AXE-Core** test ensures that the component is **compliant** with the latest WCAG 2.2 standards.
- **High Contrast Mode** visual regression tests ensure that the component is **usable** in high contrast mode.
- **Text Zoom** visual regression tests ensure that the component is **usable** with text zoomed up to 200%.
- **RTL** (Right-to-Left) tests ensure that the component is **usable** in right-to-left languages.

#### Stage 2: Manual tests

- **Keyboard Navigation** tests ensure that the component is **usable** with keyboard navigation.
- **Screen Reader** tests ensure that the component is **usable** with screen readers.

If you find any **accessibility issue**, please feel free to [**report it**](/help/bug-report).

## Web Components & accessibility

Technically our components are build out of **Web Components** to have a real single-source-of–truth regardless in which
Framework the component is used. Though Web Components are widely adopted, there are still some **accessibility
challenges**. One example is that it’s currently not possible to set `IDRef` **relationships** due to the architecture
of custom elements and their scoped shadowDOM. This represents a limitation in **ARIA** support. However, there is an
ongoing draft for a new **AOM** ([Accessibility Object Model](https://github.com/WICG/aom)), which aims to address this
issue and enhance JS-based accessibility support for all web components. We are continuously working to improve these
existing limitations.
