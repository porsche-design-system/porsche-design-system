# Versioning

<TableOfContents headings={["General information","Release planning","Deprecation and maintenance rules"]} />

We value stability and transparency. Thus we strive to ensure that our reusable components and libraries don't become
outdated and obsolete.

## General information

The Porsche Design System Libraries are released separately following [semantic versioning](https://semver.org) whereby
the numbers indicate the level of changes that are introduced. It should help you understand and plan the potential
impact of updating.

MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH e.g. v1.0.1

- **Major** (X.y.z) (breaking) changes in code or design, removal or renaming of existing features that require updates
or refactorings within the application
- **Minor** (x.Y.z) new feature (packages) in code or design
- **Patch** (x.y.Z) bug fixes or structure optimisation

## Release planning

We try to release with a regular schedule to enable the planning of updates. A major release every 6 months in summer
and winter, and up to 3 minor releases for each major release.

## Deprecation and maintenance rules

We work hard to minimize the number of breaking changes and provide migration paths. But of course, sometimes major
releases are necessary.

In general, we will mark removed, renamed or changed interfaces or elements as deprecated for one major release cycle
before we will delete them. Updates must be scheduled and integrated within 6 months.

We try to keep our major releases as easy to update as possible. Thus we only provide bug fixes for the latest major
release. Support for older major releases is stopped as soon as a new one is released.
