## Usage

### Do:

- Always choose the Light Theme as the first choice for designing Porsche applications. Stick to the limited color set
  provided.
- Use accessibility-safe colors, i.e., neutral contrast high and neutral contrast medium, to guarantee optimal contrast.
- Play with darker/lighter grey shades to make an element stand out from the background or to set emphasis on it.
- Mix color themes within the application on rarely. Ensure a sufficient contrast ratio.

### Don't:

- Don't use neutral contrast low for displaying crucial information.
- Don't mix colors of different themes (e.g. primary-light with base-dark).
- Avoid adding new colors to the color palette.
