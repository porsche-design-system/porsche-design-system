# Introduction

<TableOfContents headings={['Setup']} />

Design tokens are the visual design atoms of the Porsche Design System. Specifically, they are named entities that store
visual design attributes. We provide them as raw data, meaning they can be used with any styling solution tool or
framework.

While we offer out-of-the-box solutions and utilities for **Tailwind CSS**, **SCSS**, **Emotion**, and **Vanilla
Extract**, these integrations ultimately just consume the underlying tokens. This flexibility allows you to craft your
own custom solution or integration using the tokens directly if needed.

## Setup

All tokens are available as plain JavaScript objects and can be imported using the following path:

```js
import { colorPrimaryLight } from '@porsche-design-system/components-{js|angular|react|vue}/tokens';
```
