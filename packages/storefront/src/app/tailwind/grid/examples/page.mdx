# Grid

<TableOfContents headings={["Area","Division"]} />

The Porsche Design System Tailwind theme includes the custom `@utility` CSS classes `.grid-template`,
`.col-{narrow|basic|extended|wide|full}` and `.col-span-{one-half|one-third|two-thirds}`, which together form a generic
layout system called the "Porsche Grid". This system ensures consistent content placement and alignment across multiple
Porsche applications.

The Porsche Grid is based on native [CSS Grid](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid), changing its
available columns on mobile (6 content columns + 2 safe zone columns) and desktop view >= 760px viewport width
(8-narrow/12-basic/14-extended/16-wide content columns + 2 safe zone columns). It has a size range between 320px and
2560px, using fluid sized columns and gaps.

The Porsche Grid must be applied once at the top level, **span the full viewport width**, and cannot be nested.

## Area

`.grid-template` defines a new instance of the Porsche Grid. Although content placement is flexible across any CSS grid
column, predefined areas `full`, `wide`, `extended`, `basic` and `narrow` are provided for consistency.

## Division

Predefined areas can inherit the Porsche Grid using CSS subgrid (`.grid`, `.grid-cols-subgrid`), enabling layout
divisions such as `one-half`, `one-third` (`basic` area only) and `two-thirds` (`basic` area only).
