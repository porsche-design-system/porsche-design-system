# Grid

<TableOfContents headings={["Areas","Tiles"]} />

The Porsche grid system is based on native [CSS Grid](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid) for best
performance, changing its available columns on mobile (6 content columns + 2 safe zone columns) and desktop view >=
760px viewport width (8-narrow/12-basic/14-extended/16-wide content columns + 2 safe zone columns). It has a size range
between 320px and 2560px, using fluid sized columns and gaps.

<Notification heading="Important" headingTag="h3" state="info">
  The Porsche grid has to be used on a top level and can't be nested.
