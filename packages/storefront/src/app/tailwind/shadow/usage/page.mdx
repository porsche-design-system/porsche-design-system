# Drop Shadow

<TableOfContents headings={[]} />

## Usage

### Do:

- Reduce the use of shadows within the panels. Rather use a combination of different background colors like base and
  surface to create a visual hierarchy.
- Use same style for common components that are arranged in the row.
- Reserve drop-shadow for elements that require it, such as flyouts, notifications, or navigation menus.
- Use medium for sticky elements.
- Use high for element that have high priority.
