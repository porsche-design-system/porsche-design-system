## Usage

### Do:

- Use breakpoints as building blocks of responsive design to control layout adaptation at specific viewport or device
  sizes.
- Follow a mobile-first approach, starting with the breakpoint base and layering on styles for larger devices.
- Test the application on different breakpoints to ensure that it works on all devices.
