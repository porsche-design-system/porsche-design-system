## Usage

### Border Radius

#### Do:

- Use the large border-radius for parent elements such as images and containers.
- Adapt nested elements within a parent element with a medium border-radius for better visual appearance.
- Use the small border-radius for all interactive elements (e.g. Buttons).
- Icons should be designed with a 2px border-radius when feasible.

#### Don't:

- Don't use other border-radius than the defined tokens.
- Don't use a border-radius when an element touches the side of a parent element or the browser.

### Border Width

Standardized stroke-widths are used for all components for a consistent appearance.

#### Don't

- Use borders to create a minimalistic interface. Use other than the defined stroke widths.
