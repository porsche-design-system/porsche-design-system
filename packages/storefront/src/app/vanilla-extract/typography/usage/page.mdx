<TableOfContents headings={[]} />

## Usage

Fluid typography scales up or down based on the size of the viewing device or browser window within a predefined min-max
font size. This is in contrast to static font sizes, which are set to a specific pixel value and do not scale according
to the viewport.

### Do:

- Use fluid font styles as default.
- Section headings should be center-aligned.
- Ensure that all headlines have the same vertical line of the grid when left-aligned.
- Use only predefined font styles for text, headline, and display copy to ensure a proportional scaling of all copies,
  aligned with the fluid spacers, and a consistent appearance over all products.
- Use display styles for either hero intro, stats, or emotional moments.
- Use headline-xx-large for dedicated appointing of a section.
- Use text-styles for running text.
- Text-small is the default, but a bigger text style can be picked for introductions and short descriptions.
- Pair a headline style with a text style one or two steps below (e.g. headline-large with text-medium).
- Use text-xx-small only for disclaimers/consumption.

### Don't:

- Don't use static font styles.
- Don't use thin or any italic style of the Porsche Next.
