# Grid

<TableOfContents headings={['Area', 'Division']} />

The Porsche Design System Vanilla Extract styles include the `gridStyle` JS Object and multiple JS Variables, which
together form a generic layout system called the "Porsche Grid". This system ensures consistent content placement and
alignment across multiple Porsche applications.

The Porsche Grid is based on native [CSS Grid](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid), changing its
available columns on mobile (6 content columns + 2 safe zone columns) and desktop view >= 760px viewport width
(8-narrow/12-basic/14-extended/16-wide content columns + 2 safe zone columns). It has a size range between 320px and
2560px, using fluid sized columns and gaps.

The Porsche Grid must be applied once at the top level, **span the full viewport width**, and cannot be nested.

Styles import:
`import { gridStyle, gridBasicColumnStart, gridBasicSpanOneHalf, … } from '@porsche-design-system/components-{js|angular|react|vue}/styles/vanilla-extract';`

## Area

`gridStyle` defines a new instance of the Porsche Grid. Although content placement is flexible across any CSS grid
column, predefined areas `full`, `wide`, `extended`, `basic` and `narrow` are provided for consistency. Apply the JS
style `...gridStyle` to your wrapper element and use the JS Variables to assign the desired area to your content
elements.

## Division

Predefined areas can inherit the Porsche Grid using CSS subgrid, enabling layout divisions such as `one-half`,
`one-third` (`basic` area only) and `two-thirds` (`basic` area only).
