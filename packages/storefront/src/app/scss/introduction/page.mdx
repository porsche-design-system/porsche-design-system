# Introduction

<TableOfContents headings={['Styles', 'Setup', 'Color Scheme']} />

## Styles

Styles are the foundational layer of our design language and define basics like colors in different themes, typography
and other effects that can be applied to objects; or to define the structure and appearance with layout grid and
spacings.

You should only use the styles whenever you have to build a custom component or pattern that is not yet available in the
components library or for foundational layout objects like typography, surfaces and boxes.

## Setup

### 1. Install SASS

Follow the official installation guide:

[Install SASS Documentation](https://sass-lang.com/install/)

### 2. Import the Porsche Design System SCSS Styles

Add the following line to your SCSS file:

```scss
@use '@porsche-design-system/components-{js|angular|react|vue}/scss' as pds;
```

### 3. Include the Color Scheme Mixin

Include the `@mixin color-scheme()` in your global styles to enable the color scheme utilities and add a polyfill for
browsers that don’t yet support `light-dark()`. See the [Color Scheme](#color-scheme) section for details.

```scss
// global styles
@use '@porsche-design-system/components-{js|angular|react|vue}/scss' as pds;

@include pds.color-scheme();

html, body {…}
```

## Color Scheme

All colors and styles are driven by the CSS
[`color-scheme`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Reference/Properties/color-scheme) property. To ensure
broad compatibility, we provide the `@mixin color-scheme()`, which generates utility classes and includes a polyfill for
browsers that do not yet support `light-dark()` (see
[browser support](https://caniuse.com/mdn-css_types_color_light-dark)).

### Core Implementation

The color system leverages the CSS
[`light-dark()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Reference/Values/color_value/light-dark) function to
deliver native, preference-based theming. By adopting this browser-native engine, we have eliminated the need for
proprietary switching logic, resulting in a more performant and standardized architecture.

#### Utility Classes

Apply these classes to the document or any container to control the theme context:

- `.scheme-light` — Forces light mode.
- `.scheme-dark` — Forces dark mode.
- `.scheme-light-dark` — Dynamically follows system/OS settings.

### Usage

#### 1. Global Setup

Include the mixin once in your global stylesheet to initialize the theme utilities.

```scss
// global styles
@use '@porsche-design-system/components-js/scss' as pds;

@include pds.color-scheme();

html, body {…}
```

#### 2. Component Implementation

Utilize the new tokens within your styles. These variables automatically resolve to the correct value based on the
active theme.

```scss
// custom component styles
@use '@porsche-design-system/components-{js\|angular\|react\|vue}/scss' as pds;

.my-component {
  // Use light-dark() color variables
  background-color: pds.$color-frosted;
  color: pds.$color-primary;
}
```

#### 3. Application

The defined theme context will cascade to all child elements.

```html
<!-- Defined theme will be applied to all child elements -->
<html class="scheme-dark">
  <head></head>
  <body>
    <!-- Will be rendered in dark mode -->
    <div class="my-component"></div>
  </body>
</html>
```
