The `p-flyout` is a overlay from the left or right side of the screen. It is commonly used as a temporary workspace that
allows users to complete tasks without navigating to a new page or as a mobile navigation.

It is a controlled component. This grants flexible control over the flyout's behavior especially whether it should stay
open after user interaction like submission of a form.

<Notification heading="Scroll-lock" heading-tag="h2" state="warning">
  This component sets <code>overflow: hidden</code> on the body when opened in order to prevent background scrolling.<br />
  This doesn't work completely reliable under iOS but is the most stable solution.<br />
  Feel free to address this issue in an Open Source PR, if you can provide a better solution. <b><Link href="https://github.com/porsche-design-system/porsche-design-system/blob/main/packages/components/src/utils/setScrollLock.ts">Current implementation</Link></b>
