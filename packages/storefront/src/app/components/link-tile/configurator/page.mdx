# Link Tile <ComponentStatus tagName="p-link-tile"></ComponentStatus>

The `p-link-tile` is a navigational component that displays a provided image to tease content and navigate to further
information within one container. In case you want the user to execute an action, you should select the
[Button Tile](/components/button-tile/) component instead.

**Note:** The component does not take care of processing and aligning the image.

An `<img/>`, `<picture/>` or `<video/>` tag has to be provided as default slot.

Additionally, the properties `href`, `description` and `label` are required. The `description` property is used as a
teaser with a more detailed description of the link and where it leads to.

The `label` property is used to describe the anchor.
