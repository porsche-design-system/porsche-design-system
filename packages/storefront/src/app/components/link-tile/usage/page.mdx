## Usage

The following segment provides instructions for designers and developers regarding the appropriate utilization of this
component in various situations.

### Do:

- Use Link-Tile for prominent links with appropriate aspect ratios and short descriptions (80 characters or fewer).
- Use [Button-Tile](/components/button-tile) instead if you want on-page interactivity.
- Use basic Link-Tile for better perception tests and compact Link-Tile for improved spacing (especially on mobile).
- Use gradient Link-Tile when image contrast is insufficient and select images with natural contrast.
- Use font size for visual hierarchy and customize image type and font size for responsiveness.
- Use engaging verbs and product names in compact Link Tile. Create assets upfront for image processing.

### Don't:

- Don't manipulate images, keep them natural and contrasted.
- Don't write long descriptions that overflow content (especially on mobile).
