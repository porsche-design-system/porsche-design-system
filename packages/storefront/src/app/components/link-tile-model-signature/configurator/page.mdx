# Link Tile Model Signature <ComponentStatus tagName="p-link-tile-model-signature"></ComponentStatus>

The `p-link-tile-model-signature` is a navigational component that displays a provided image to tease content and
provides two `p-link's` to navigate to further information within one container. In addition to the `p-link-tile` it
shows one of the model signatures at the top.

**Note:** The component does not take care of processing and aligning the image.

An `<img/>`, `<picture/>` or `<video/>` tag has to be provided as default slot.

It is required to have two `p-link` components as named slots, `slot="primary"` and `slot="secondary"`.
The `heading` property is required, too. It is used as a teaser with a more detailed description of where the link leads
to.
