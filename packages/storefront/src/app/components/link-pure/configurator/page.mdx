# Link Pure <ComponentStatus tagName="p-link-pure"></ComponentStatus>

The `p-link-pure` component is essential for performing changes in **page routes**. A Link Pure can be used with or
without a label, but it's recommended to keep the **label visible** for better **usability** whenever possible. When
used without a label, it is mandatory for **accessibility** to provide a descriptive label text for screen readers.

In case you want the user to execute an action, you should select the [Button](/components/button/) or
[Button Pure](/components/button-pure/) component instead.

You can use native `click`, `focus`, `focusin`, `blur` and `focusout` events on the `p-link-pure`.
