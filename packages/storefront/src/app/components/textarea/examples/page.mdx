## Form

The `p-textarea` can be integrated into a form in two ways: **controlled** or **uncontrolled**, depending on your needs.

In the **controlled** approach, the textarea state is externally managed using the `value` property and `input` event to
keep it in sync with your application logic. This approach is ideal for complex forms or when using a form library. Note
that the component will still always update its internal value automatically when interacted with.

In the **uncontrolled** approach, the textarea behaves similar to a native `<textarea>`, automatically managing its own
state and including its value in form submissions through the
[ElementInternals](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/ElementInternals) API. This is convenient for
smaller forms or simple submissions.

For more details on form integration, refer to the `Form` section in the
[developing documentation](/developing/introduction) for your framework of choice, or find a full form integration
example in our [examples repository](https://github.com/porsche-design-system/examples/tree/v3/frameworks).

## Slots

Sometimes it's useful to be able to render markup (e.g. an anchor tag) for `label` or `message`. Therefore a named slot
can be used. Make sure **not** to define the corresponding property on the host element when a named slot is used
(because a property definition is preferred over a named slot). For named slots only
[phrasing content](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/HTML/Content_categories#Phrasing_content) is
allowed.

In addition to the named slots `label`, `description` and `message`, there is also a `label-after` slot available. This
slot must be used to render content after the label which is not directly part of it (e.g. an external link or a
`popover` component).

<Notification heading="Attention" heading-tag="h3" state="warning">
  In <code>disabled/loading</code> state, slotted focusable UI elements (e.g. <code>a</code>) will still receive keyboard focus. Add <code>tabindex="-1"</code> to those UI elements.

The <code>label-after</code> slot is not affected by a <code>disabled/loading</code> state at all.
