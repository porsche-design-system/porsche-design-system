# Textarea <ComponentStatus tagName="p-textarea"></ComponentStatus>

The `p-textarea` component is a multi-line text input control. Don't use a Textarea component if you want to allow users
to enter shorter responses that are no longer than a single line, such as a phone number or name. In this case, you
should use the Text Field component.

A `label` is a caption which informs the user what information a particular form field is asking for. The `p-textarea`
component can be used with or without a label, but it's recommended to keep the label visible for better accessibility
whenever possible. When used without a label, it's mandatory to provide a descriptive label text for screen readers.

While a `placeholder` is optional but recommended to be set whenever bits of example content or hints shall be shown to
give the user visual cues to fill out the form.

  When the <code>p-textarea</code> component is used within a form, it utilizes the
  <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/ElementInternals">ElementInternals</a> API, which has limited
  browser support. For broader browser compatibility, consider using a
  <a href="components/textarea/examples#controlled">controlled</a> approach instead.

Instead of relying on slotted content, the `p-textarea` component offers a `value` attribute and property that remain
synchronized with user input.
