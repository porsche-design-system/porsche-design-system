# Textarea <ComponentStatus tagName="p-textarea"></ComponentStatus>

The `p-textarea` component is a multi-line text input control. Don't use a Textarea component if you want to allow users
to enter shorter responses that are no longer than a single line, such as a phone number or name. In this case, you
should use one of the input components.

A `label` is a caption which informs the user what information a particular form field is asking for. The `p-textarea`
component can be used with or without a label, but it's recommended to keep the label visible for better accessibility
whenever possible. When used without a label, it's mandatory to provide a descriptive label text for screen readers.

While a `placeholder` is optional but recommended to be set whenever bits of example content or hints shall be shown to
give the user visual cues to fill out the form.

Instead of relying on slotted content, the `p-textarea` component offers a `value` attribute and property that remain
synchronized with user input.
