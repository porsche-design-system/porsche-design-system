# Input Password <ComponentStatus tagName="p-input-password"></ComponentStatus>

The `p-input-password` component enables secure password entry by obscuring the typed characters. Displayed as a
one-line plain text editor, it ensures the password remains hidden to protect user privacy. Additionally, the component
includes a toggle button that allows users to reveal the password in clear text when needed, offering both security and
convenience.

A `label` is a caption which informs the user what information a particular form field is asking for. The
`p-input-password` component can be used with or without a label, but it's recommended to keep the label visible for
better accessibility whenever possible. When used without a label, it's mandatory to provide a descriptive label text
for screen readers.

While a `placeholder` is optional but recommended to be set whenever bits of example content or hints shall be shown to
give the user visual cues to fill out the form.
