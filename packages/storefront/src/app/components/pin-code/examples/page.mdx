## Form

The `p-pin-code` can be integrated into a form in two ways: **controlled** or **uncontrolled**, depending on your needs.

In the **controlled** approach, the input state is externally managed using the `value` property and `change` event to
keep it in sync with your application logic. This approach is ideal for complex forms or when using a form library. Note
that the component will still always update its internal value automatically when interacted with.

In the **uncontrolled** approach, the input behaves similar to a single native `<input type="text" />`, automatically
managing its own state and including its value in form submissions through the
[ElementInternals](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/ElementInternals) API.

<Notification heading="Attention" heading-tag="h2" state="warning">
  <code>p-pin-code</code> does not use a single native input internally. As a result, it lacks access to native{' '}
  <code>ValidityState</code>
  properties and <code>validationMessage</code>, and it cannot display the native validation popover. This means
  validation behavior and error display will need to be implemented separately if required.

For more details on form integration, refer to the `Form` section in the
[developing documentation](/developing/introduction) for your framework of choice, or find a full form integration
example in our [examples repository](https://github.com/porsche-design-system/examples/tree/v3/frameworks).

<ComponentExample codeSample={pinCodeExampleForm} />

## Copy+Paste and autocomplete

By default, only one input can be changed at a time. The `p-pin-code` component also supports copying and pasting a
value and OTP auto-suggestion on mobile.

The `p-pin-code` component performs basic validation of the pasted value:

- If the pasted string is too long the `p-pin-code` attempts to fill in the other inputs.
- If the pasted value contains whitespaces, these will be removed.
- If the value contains other characters than digits, the value can not be pasted.

Try copy+paste `1234` into any of the inputs in the example below.

## Slots

Sometimes it's useful to be able to render markup (e.g. an anchor tag) for `label`, `description` or `message`.
Therefore, a named slot can be used. Make sure **not** to define the corresponding property on the host element when a
named slot is used (because a property definition is preferred over a named slot). For named slots only
[phrasing content](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/HTML/Content_categories#Phrasing_content) is
allowed.

In addition to the named slots `label`, `description` and `message`, there is also a `label-after` slot available. This
slot must be used to render content after the label which is not directly part of it (e.g. an external link or a
`popover` component).

<Notification heading="Attention" heading-tag="h3" state="warning">
  If the <code>component</code> is in <code>disabled/loading</code> state
  <strong>and</strong> <code>label</code> or <code>label-after</code> slots are used with focusable UI elements (e.g.
  <code>a</code> or <code>p-popover</code>), the keyboard focus handling has to be managed manually to prevent focusing
  disabled elements (e.g. add <code>tabindex="-1"</code> on those UI elements).
