## Form

The `p-pin-code` component is a form-associated custom element that integrates seamlessly with forms. Leveraging the
[ElementInternals](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/ElementInternals) API, it functions like a native
input, ensuring compatibility with form behaviors. However, note that browser support for this API is limited.

To ensure proper submission of the form, it's required to provide an individual `name` prop to the `p-pin-code`
component, enabling the `p-pin-code`'s value to be included in the form's data when it is submitted.

<Notification heading="Attention" heading-tag="h2" state="warning">
  <code>p-pin-code</code> does not use a native input internally. As a result, it lacks access to native <code>ValidityState</code>
  properties and <code>validationMessage</code>, and it cannot display the native validation popover. This means validation behavior
  and error display will need to be implemented separately if required.
</Notification>

<ComponentExample codeSample={pinCodeExample} />

## Controlled

We do not envision a lot of scenarios where you would need this level of control, however the `p-pin-code` can be used
as a controlled component. This means it does not contain any internal state, and you got full control over its
behavior. Any change of the input's values triggers a custom update event and the value is updated immediately. The prop
`value` is an array of strings synchronized with the input's values.

## Copy+Paste and autocomplete

By default, only one input can be changed at a time. The `p-pin-code` component also supports copying and pasting a
value and OTP auto-suggestion on mobile.

The `p-pin-code` component performs basic validation of the pasted value:

- If the pasted string is too long the `p-pin-code` attempts to fill in the other inputs.
- If the pasted value contains whitespaces, these will be removed.
- If the value contains other characters than digits, the value can not be pasted.

Try copy+paste `1234` into any of the inputs in the example below.
