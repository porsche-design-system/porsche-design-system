# Pin Code <ComponentStatus tagName="p-pin-code"></ComponentStatus>

The `p-pin-code` component is optimized for entering sequences of digits. The most common use case is for entering
one-time-passwords (OTP) or pin codes. The input fields allow only one digit at a time. When a digit is entered, the
focus shifts automatically to the next input, until every input is filled.

A few things to note:

- Only digits can be entered.
- Only one digit can be entered per input.
- Pressing `Delete` or `Backspace`: If the focussed input is blank and `Delete`/`Backspace` is pressed the focus
transfers to the next/previous input, and clears the value of the next/previous input (if any). This avoids the need
to explicitly `Shift+Tab & Delete`/ `Tab & Backspace`.

  When the <code>p-pin-code</code> component is used within a form, it utilizes the
  <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/ElementInternals">ElementInternals</a> API, which has limited
  browser support. For broader browser compatibility, consider using a
  <a href="components/textarea/examples#controlled">controlled</a> approach instead.

A `label` is a caption which informs the user what information a particular form field is asking for. The `p-pin-code`
component can be used with or without a label, but it's recommended to keep the label visible for better accessibility
whenever possible. When used without a label, it's best practice to provide a descriptive label text for screen readers.
