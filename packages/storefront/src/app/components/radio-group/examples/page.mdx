## Form

The `p-radio-group` can be integrated into a form in two ways: **controlled** or **uncontrolled**, depending on your
needs.

In the **controlled** approach, the `p-radio-group` state is externally managed using the `value` property and `change`
event to keep it in sync with your application logic. This approach is ideal for complex forms or when using a form
library. Note that the component will still always update its internal value automatically when interacted with.

In the **uncontrolled** approach, the `p-radio-group` automatically managing its own state and includes its value in
form submissions through the [ElementInternals](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/ElementInternals) API.
This is convenient for smaller forms or simple submissions.

For more details on form integration, refer to the `Form` section in the
[developing documentation](/developing/introduction) for your framework of choice, or find a full form integration
example in our [examples repository](https://github.com/porsche-design-system/examples/tree/v3/frameworks).

## Slots

Sometimes it's useful to render custom markup for `label` or `message`. Therefore, named slots can be used. Make sure
**not** to define the corresponding property on the host element when a named slot is used (because a property
definition is preferred over a named slot). For named slots only
[phrasing content](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/HTML/Content_categories#Phrasing_content) is
allowed.

In addition to the named slots `label` and `message`, there is also a `label-after` slot available. This slot must be
used to render content after the label which is not directly part of it (e.g. an external link or a `p-popover`
component).

<Notification heading="Attention" heading-tag="h3" state="warning">
  In <code>disabled/loading</code> state, slotted focusable UI elements (e.g. <code>a</code>) will still receive keyboard focus. Add <code>tabindex="-1"</code> to those UI elements.

The <code>label-after</code> slot is not affected by a <code>disabled/loading</code> state at all.
