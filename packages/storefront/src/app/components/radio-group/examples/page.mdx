## Form

The `p-radio-group` can be integrated into a form in two ways: **controlled** or **uncontrolled**, depending on your
needs.

In the **controlled** approach, the `p-radio-group` state is externally managed using the `value` property and `change`
event to keep it in sync with your application logic. This approach is ideal for complex forms or when using a form
library. Note that the component will still always update its internal value automatically when interacted with.

In the **uncontrolled** approach, the `p-radio-group` automatically managing its own state and includes its value in
form submissions through the [ElementInternals](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/ElementInternals) API.
This is convenient for smaller forms or simple submissions.

For more details on form integration, refer to the `Form` section in the
[developing documentation](/developing/introduction) for your framework of choice, or find a full form integration
example in our [examples repository](https://github.com/porsche-design-system/examples/tree/v3/frameworks).

## Slots

Sometimes it's useful to be able to render markup (e.g. an anchor tag) for `label`, `description` or `message` **or**
adding additional markup (e.g. `popover`) at the start/end of a `label`. Therefore, a named slot can be used. Make sure
**not** to define the corresponding property on the host element when a named slot is used (because a property
definition is preferred over a named slot). For named slots only
[phrasing content](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/HTML/Content_categories#Phrasing_content) is
allowed.
