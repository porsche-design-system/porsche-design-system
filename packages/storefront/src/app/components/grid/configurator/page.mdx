The `p-grid` provides a visual structuring system for a homogeneous and balanced content placement across all Porsche
web experiences and screen sizes. The Porsche Design System grid system is based upon a standard 12 column responsive
grid. Its main purpose is to provide a solid and flexible grid system for defining layout areas and page structures. It
is not meant to function as a toolkit for layout content blocks or components.

<Notification heading="Deprecation hint" heading-tag="h2" state="error">
  This component is deprecated and will be removed with the next major release.
  In general, please use native <a href="https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid">CSS Grid</a> instead for better performance and more standardized layout technique.
  Additionally, we provide a <a href="/styles/grid/"><b>Porsche Grid</b></a> utility instead based on CSS Grid covering the specific layout needs for a harmonic appearance across all digital touch-points.
