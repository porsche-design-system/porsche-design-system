  The <code>p-drilldown</code> component is experimental and might be changed or removed in a future release.

The `p-drilldown` component is meant for displaying an infinite multilevel structure in a drilldown menu that overlays
the page content from the start side of the screen. It is a controlled component that gives you flexible control over
its behavior.

The basic concept of the component is to have a button that opens the `p-drilldown` with an infinite multilevel
structure. The levels are generated out of `p-drilldown-item` which generates a list of cascade buttons to navigate to a
deeper level, back buttons and a header section on mobile view. These items can be filled with e.g. `p-drilldown-link`,
another `p-drilldown-item` or any HTML element.

The visibility of `p-drilldown` can be controlled by its `open` property.

It's **obligatory** that each `p-drilldown-item` has a unique `identifier` and `label` defined.

Since it's a controlled component it's necessary to register an event listener for the `dismiss` and `update` event in
order to get notified when `p-drilldown` needs to be closed or navigated to another hierarchy level.
