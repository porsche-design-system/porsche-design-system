## Indeterminate

Mask the visual appearance of a checkbox which has a state in-between checked and unchecked.
This is especially useful for a checkbox that is used to set the state of a group of checkboxes at once. However, this
group might have a mixed state. In this case we recommend to use `checked=false` and `indeterminate=true`.

**Note: The `indeterminate` attribute only affects how the checkbox is shown. The current value is hidden from the user,
but the checkbox still keeps it's `checked` state. You can find more details in
[the specification](https://w3.org/TR/html52/sec-forms.html#dom-htmlinputelement-indeterminate).**

## Form

The `p-checkbox` component is a form-associated custom element that integrates seamlessly with forms. Leveraging the
[ElementInternals](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/ElementInternals) API, it functions like a native
checkbox, ensuring compatibility with form behaviors. However, note that browser support for this API is limited.

## Controlled

In the controlled approach, the `p-checkbox` checked state is externally managed. While the internal checked state will
be updated automatically, you can use the `update` or `blur` event to update the external state.

## Slots

Sometimes it's useful to be able to render markup (e.g. an anchor tag) for `label` or `message`. Therefore, a named slot
can be used. Make sure **not** to define the corresponding property on the host element when a named slot is used
(because a property definition is preferred over a named slot). For named slots only
[phrasing content](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/HTML/Content_categories#Phrasing_content) is
allowed.
