## Form

The `p-checkbox` can be integrated into a form in two ways: **controlled** or **uncontrolled**, depending on your needs.

In the **controlled** approach, the checkbox state is externally managed using the `checked` property and `change` event
to keep it in sync with your application logic. This approach is ideal for complex forms or when using a form library.
Note that the component will still always update its internal value automatically when interacted with.

In the **uncontrolled** approach, the checkbox behaves similar to a native `<input type="checkbox" />`, automatically
managing its own state and including its value in form submissions through the
[ElementInternals](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/ElementInternals) API. This is convenient for
smaller forms or simple submissions.

For more details on form integration, refer to the `Form` section in the
[developing documentation](/developing/introduction) for your framework of choice, or find a full form integration
example in our [examples repository](https://github.com/porsche-design-system/examples/tree/main/frameworks).

## Indeterminate

Mask the visual appearance of a checkbox which has a state in-between checked and unchecked. This is especially useful
for a checkbox that is used to set the state of a group of checkboxes at once. However, this group might have a mixed
state. In this case we recommend to use `checked=false` and `indeterminate=true`.

**Note: The `indeterminate` attribute only affects how the checkbox is shown. The current value is hidden from the user,
but the checkbox still keeps it's `checked` state. You can find more details in
[the specification](https://w3.org/TR/html52/sec-forms.html#dom-htmlinputelement-indeterminate).**

## Slots

Sometimes it's useful to be able to render markup (e.g. an anchor tag) for `label` or `message`. Therefore, a named slot
can be used. Make sure **not** to define the corresponding property on the host element when a named slot is used
(because a property definition is preferred over a named slot). For named slots only
[phrasing content](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/HTML/Content_categories#Phrasing_content) is
allowed.
