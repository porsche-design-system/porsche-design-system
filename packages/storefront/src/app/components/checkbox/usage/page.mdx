## Usage

The following segment provides instructions for designers and developers regarding the appropriate utilization of this
component in various situations.

### Do:

- Use for a list of options when you want the user to select one, none, or multiple options.
- Use when an explicit action is required to apply to settings.
- Use the default view for checkboxes when no option is selected.
- Use the indeterminate state only as a visual state and not as a direct user interaction.
- Nest when a parent and child relationship is needed.
- Use short and descriptive label text for each checkbox option.
- Provide validation messages for each checkbox option if needed.
- Set vertically left-aligned for better scannability.

### Don't:

- Avoid using when you have more than 8 options to choose from or consider using a [Select](/components/select-wrapper).
- Don't mix [Radio Button](/components/radio-button-wrapper) buttons with checkboxes.
- Don't change the selection of another checkbox when a nested one is clicked. The only exception is when a checkbox is
used to make a bulk selection of multiple items.
