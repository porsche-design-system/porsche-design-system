## Usage

The following segment provides instructions for designers and developers regarding the appropriate utilization of this
component in various situations.

### Do

- Use the `p-wordmark` as the main brand identifier.
- Use the `p-wordmark` only in dedicated situations, like global navigation.
- Position the `p-wordmark` centered whenever possible.
- Use the `p-crest` only as an additional small brand identifier (e.g., within contact cards).
- Switch from the `p-wordmark` to the `p-crest` on small viewports below 480px (automatically implemented in global
navigation and footer).

### Don't

- Use the `p-crest` as the primary brand identifier by default.
- Display the `p-wordmark` too often (usually once is enough).
