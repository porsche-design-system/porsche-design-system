# Scroller <ComponentStatus tagName="p-scroller"></ComponentStatus>

The `p-scroller` component forces its child nodes to be rendered horizontally next to each other. In case not enough
viewport space is given a clickable scroll indicator is shown and the elements become scrollable.

As soon as the slotted element(s) exceed the viewport / their respective container, scroll indicators are shown.

If the `p-scroller` component is accessed by keyboard navigation and is focused, scrolling via `arrow right` and
`arrow left` is possible. If `p-scroller` contains focusable element(s) these can be also accessed by keyboard
navigation.
