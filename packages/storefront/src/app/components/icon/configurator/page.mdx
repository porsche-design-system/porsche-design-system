Along with other Porsche basic elements - such as colors, typography and the Porsche marque - icons are core components
of the Porsche design. The clear graphic symbols allow quick orientation and are internationally recognized. The Porsche
Design System is using an **SVG icon system (integrated by `<img/>`)** to visually present an icon object. Each icon is
hosted on the Porsche Design System CDN to be served and cached as fast as possible.
