# Switch <ComponentStatus tagName="p-switch"></ComponentStatus>

The `p-switch` component is a control that is used to quickly switch between two possible states. A switch is only used
for these binary actions that occur immediately after the user “flips the switch”. Commonly it is used for “on/off”
state.

It is a controlled component. This means it does not contain any internal state, and you got full control over its
behavior.

The `p-switch` component can be used with a visible or hidden label, but it's recommended to keep the label visible for
better accessibility whenever possible. A `label` is a caption which informs the user which action is followed by
interaction. When used with hidden label, it's best practice to provide a descriptive label text for screen readers.

You can use native `click`, `focus`, `focusin`, `blur` and `focusout` events on the `p-switch`.
