## Usage

The following segment provides instructions for designers and developers regarding the appropriate utilization of this
component in various situations.

The `p-input-tel` component is specifically designed for collecting telephone numbers. It leverages built-in browser
validation to ensure that input follows the correct phone number format. This makes it a better choice than a generic
text input when phone number validation, proper keyboard behavior on mobile devices, and accessibility are important.
For further guidance, see the
[MDN documentation on tel inputs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/input/tel#using_tel_inputs).

### Do:

- Use when requesting a telephone number from the user.
- Use without a label only when the context is clear.
- Use for validation and error of input.
- Use asterisk for required fields.

### Don't:

- Don't use labels with more than two words whenever possible (keep it short and descriptive).
- Don't use an instructional or description text for the label.
