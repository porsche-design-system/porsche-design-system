The `p-button` component is essential for performing form or **interaction** events. For an optimal user guidance and
dedicated pursuit of business or sales goals, different types of Buttons (**Primary** and **Secondary**) are available
for usage. A Button can be used with or without a label but it's recommended to keep the **label visible** for better
**usability** whenever possible. When used without a label, it is mandatory for **accessibility** to provide a
descriptive label text for screen readers. Whenever you want to provide navigational elements, stick to the
[Link](/components/link/) component instead.

You can use native `click`, `focus`, `focusin`, `blur` and `focusout` events on the `p-button`.
