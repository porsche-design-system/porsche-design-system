# Button <ComponentStatus tagName="p-button"></ComponentStatus>

## Form

When used as a submit button, the `name` and `value` props are submitted as a pair as part of the form data.

<ComponentExample codeSample={buttonExampleForm} />

## Form Attribute

When a button is used as a submit or reset button outside a form, the `form` attribute can be utilized to explicitly
associate the button with a specific form element.

<Notification heading="Attention" heading-tag="h2" state="warning">
  When using the <code>p-button</code> component as a <strong>submit</strong> or <strong>reset</strong> button outside a form,
  it relies on the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/ElementInternals">ElementInternals</a> API, which has limited
  browser support.<br/><br/> As of now, the submitter in the form event is null because the button cannot be accessed within the shadow DOM
  to be passed as an argument to the <code>requestSubmit()</code> function (<a href="https://github.com/WICG/webcomponents/issues/814">WICG/webcomponents#814</a>).
  <br/><br/>Additionally, custom components using ElementInternals may include all values of elements with the same name attribute in form data, rather than only the value of
  the triggering element, deviating from native form behavior.
