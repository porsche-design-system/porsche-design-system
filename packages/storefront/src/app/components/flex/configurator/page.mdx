# Flex <ComponentStatus tagName="p-flex"></ComponentStatus>

The Porsche Design System flex layout system is based on standard CSS Flexbox browser behaviour and can be controlled by
the properties of the `p-flex` container and `p-flex-item`. It can be used to quickly layout standard content blocks or
components.
