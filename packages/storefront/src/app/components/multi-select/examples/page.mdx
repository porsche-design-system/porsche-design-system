## Form

The `p-multi-select` can be integrated into a form in two ways: **controlled** or **uncontrolled**, depending on your
needs.

In the **controlled** approach, the select state is externally managed using the `value` property and `change` event to
keep it in sync with your application logic. This approach is ideal for complex forms or when using a form library. Note
that the component will still always update its internal value automatically when interacted with.

In the **uncontrolled** approach, the select behaves similar to a native `<select multiple>`, automatically managing its
own state and including its value in form submissions through the
[ElementInternals](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/ElementInternals) API. This is convenient for
smaller forms or simple submissions.

<Notification heading="Attention" heading-tag="h2" state="warning">
  <code>p-multi-select</code> does not use a native select internally. As a result, it lacks access to native{' '}
  <code>ValidityState</code>
  properties and <code>validationMessage</code>, and it cannot display the native validation popover. This means
  validation behavior and error display will need to be implemented separately if required.

For more details on form integration, refer to the `Form` section in the
[developing documentation](/developing/introduction) for your framework of choice, or find a full form integration
example in our [examples repository](https://github.com/porsche-design-system/examples/tree/main/frameworks).

## Set Value

The `p-multi-select` component behaves like regular form elements. It updates its value automatically based on user
choices, but can also be changed manually by using the value property. This property takes an array of strings that
represent the selected option values.
