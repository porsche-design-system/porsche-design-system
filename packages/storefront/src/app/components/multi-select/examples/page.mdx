## Form

The `p-multi-select` component is a form-associated custom element that integrates seamlessly with forms. Leveraging the
[ElementInternals](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/ElementInternals) API, it functions similar to a
native select, ensuring compatibility with form behaviors. However, note that browser support for this API is limited.

When used within a form element, it's required to provide a name attribute to the `p-multi-select` component. This
attribute establishes the link between the component and the form, enabling the selected values to be included in the
form's data when it's submitted.

<Notification heading="Attention" heading-tag="h2" state="warning">
  <code>p-multi-select</code> does not use a native select internally. As a result, it lacks access to native <code>ValidityState</code>
  properties and <code>validationMessage</code>, and it cannot display the native validation popover. This means validation behavior
  and error display will need to be implemented separately if required.

## Controlled

In the controlled approach, the `p-multi-select` component is externally controlled. Selected options trigger a custom
update event, allowing you to use the updated value. Internally, the value will be updated automatically but can be
overwritten by passing in a new value.

<ComponentExample codeSample={multiSelectExampleControlled} />

## Set Value

The `p-multi-select` component behaves like regular form elements. It updates its value automatically based on user
choices, but can also be changed manually by using the value property. This property takes an array of strings that
represent the selected option values.
