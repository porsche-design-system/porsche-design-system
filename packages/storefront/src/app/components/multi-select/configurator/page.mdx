The `p-multi-select` component is a versatile custom form element that facilitates the selection of multiple options. It
can be used [within a form](components/multi-select/examples#form) or in a
[controlled manner](components/multi-select/examples#controlled).

<Notification heading="Attention" heading-tag="h2" state="warning">
  When the <code>p-multi-select</code> component is used within a form, it utilizes the
  <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/ElementInternals">ElementInternals</a> API, which has limited
  browser support. For broader browser compatibility, consider using a
  <a href="components/multi-select/examples#controlled">controlled</a> approach instead.

Many of the properties closely resemble those found in the [select-wrapper](/components/select-wrapper/examples/) and
other form components (e.g. `label`, `description`, `state`, `message`, `hideLabel`, `disabled`, `required` &
`dropdownDirection`). The `p-multi-select` offers a search field by default. When the user types in a search string, the
options are reduced by matching the options text.

Options are slotted using the `p-multi-select-option` component. Each option needs to have an assigned value, which can
be passed via an attribute or property and needs to be of type string. Initial selection states can only be achieved
using the value property on the `p-multi-select` component ([More Info](/components/multi-select/examples/#set-value)).
Options don't have a selected attribute or property. If an option should be visible but not selectable, it can be
disabled by using the `disabled` attribute.

**Hint:** The `p-multi-select` utilizes the [Popover API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Popover_API) to render its dropdown on the `#top-layer` which enables it to be shown correctly even when used e.g. within a scroll container.
