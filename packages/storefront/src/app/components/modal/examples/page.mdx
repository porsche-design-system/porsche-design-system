## Scrollable modal with sticky footer

If the modal's content does not fit into the current boundaries the content becomes scrollable and the footer area
sticky.

## Modal as alert dialog

The `p-modal` component can be used as an alert dialog. This is a modal dialog that interrupts the user's workflow to
draw attention to an important message and requires a response.

<ComponentStory story={modalStoryAlertDialog} />

## Custom styling

The modal component has some values which can be overwritten by CSS Custom Properties (aka CSS Variables). This might be
useful for e.g. a "Cookie Consent Dialog" to reserve certain space when used with `backdrop: 'shading'` to always have
the Porsche [crest](/components/crest/) or [wordmark](/components/wordmark/) visible in the background of the page. Since
the modal is centered within the viewport and shrinks to its content, the custom vertical spacing definition will act
like a safe zone.

In addition, it's possible to make containers or elements (e.g. `div`, `img` etc.) stretch into the padding safe-zone by
adding the <code v-text="stretchClassName"></code> CSS class.

```scss
// the modal comes with predefined margin / safe-zone which needs to be considered when a custom width is defined
--p-modal-width: clamp(276px, 45.25vw + 131px, 1000px);
--p-modal-spacing-top: 200px;
--p-modal-spacing-bottom: 50px;
```
