## Accessibility support

### Keyboard

| Key / state        | Function                                                 |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Tab`, `Shift-Tab` | Moves focus to the next (or previous) focusable element. |
| `Enter`, `Space`   | Activates the button.                                    |
| `disabled`         | Button still focusable.                                  |

### ARIA enhancements

#### External **ARIA** provided by the `aria` property:

| ARIA            | Usage                                                                                                                                         |
| --------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `aria-label`    | Defines a string value that labels an interactive element. It's required for buttons with `hideLabel="true"`.                                 |
| `aria-expanded` | Exposes a visual state (e.g. expanded/collapsed) of another element.                                                                          |
| `aria-pressed`  | Exposes the `pressed` state of a toggle button.                                                                                               |
| `aria-haspopup` | Defines that the button opens a popup (e.g. `dialog`). It can be used in combination with `aria-expanded` to indicate the state of the popup. |

## Limitations

Due to the nature of **Web Components** and **shadowDOM**, there are limitations in the usage of some **ARIA**
attributes if they try to set relationship between elements in different shadowDOM's or shadowDOM/lightDOM combinations.

| ARIA                    | Support |
| ----------------------- | ------- |
| `aria-labelledby`       | ðŸš«      |
| `aria-describedby`      | ðŸš«      |
| `aria-owns`             | ðŸš«      |
| `aria-controls`         | ðŸš«      |
| `aria-activedescendant` | ðŸš«      |

## Development considerations

### Text over image or video

In general, placing textual contents above an image or video can easily lead to **contrast issues**. Though we are
providing a scalable background gradient to reduce the risk of low contrasts between foreground text and background
image, there still can occur issues with color contrast ratios, especially if different aspect ratios for multiple
viewport sizes are used. So, always **check readability** and play around with the `size` and `weight` properties to
achieve the best results.

### Reduced motion

In case a video background is used, the component checks whether **reduced motion** is enabled in the operating system
settings and prevents the `<video autoplay loop />` attribute from working to improve accessibility & UX. In addition,
the slotted video should have no audio or is muted by `<video muted />`. Also keep in mind that long videos or videos in
general might increase the page load time. The video content should support the **CTA** instead of distracting from it.
To support screen reader users, it's recommended to define an alternative video description
`<video aria-label="Some video description"" />`.
