<TableOfContents headings={["UI behaviour","Hyphens"]} />

## UI behaviour

The component is able to break out of its aspect ratio in case content overflows to be accessibility compliant (see
first row in example).

Additionally, the component is able to align to the highest CSS Grid child independent of the aspect ratio when used in
CSS Grid context (see second row in example).

<Notification heading="Browser Support Limitation" heading-tag="h3" state="warning">
  Currently, Safari is only able to align the height per CSS Grid row as long as the content does not overflow.
</Notification>

<ComponentStory story={buttonTileStoryGrid} />

## Hyphens

It is possible to overwrite the hyphens style on the host element and use 'soft' hyphens. However, please note that
hyphenation behavior can vary depending on the browser and the language of the text. In some cases, it may be necessary
to set the appropriate lang attribute on your HTML element to ensure that hyphenation works correctly for the desired
language.
