The `p-button-tile` is an interactive component that displays a provided image to tease content and performs form or
**interaction** events within one container. Whenever you want to provide navigational elements, stick to the
[Link Tile](/components/link-tile/) component instead.

**Note:** The component does not take care of processing and aligning the image.

An `<img/>`, `<picture/>` or `<video/>` tag has to be provided as default slot.

Additionally, the properties `description` and `label` are required. The `description` property is used as a teaser with
a more detailed description of the button and its action.

The `label` property is used to describe the button.
