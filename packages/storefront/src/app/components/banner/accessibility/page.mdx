## Accessibility support

### Keyboard

| Key / state | Function                                      |
| ----------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| `ESC`       | Closes the Banner                             |
| `focus`     | Moves focus automatically to the close button |

### ARIA enhancements

#### Internal **ARIA** that is managed by the component:

| ARIA                       | Usage                                                                                                     |
| -------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `role="status"`            | When content is populated or changed in `state="info"`, the component announces them unobtrusively        |
| `role="alert"`             | When content is populated or changed in `state="warning/error"`, the component announces them immediately |
| `aria-labelledby="IDREF"`  | The Banner is labelled by the `heading` prop or its corresponding slot                                    |
| `aria-describedby="IDREF"` | The Banner is described by the `description` prop or its corresponding slot                               |
| `aria-hidden="true"`       | State `icon` is hidden from the screen reader                                                             |
| `aria-controls="ID"`       | Exposes relationship of close button                                                                      |

## Development considerations

### Focus handling

To support **keyboard navigation**, please take care of correct **focus handling** after closing the Banner with `ESC`
or `Enter` key: The trigger element (e.g. a button) which has opened the Banner must receive focus state again after the
Banner is closed. This is important to keep focus order consistent.
