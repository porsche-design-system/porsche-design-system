## Accessibility support

### Keyboard

| Key / state        | Function                                       |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------- |
| `ESC`              | Closes the Banner.                             |
| `Tab`, `Shift-Tab` | Moves focus to the next focusable element.     |
| `focus`            | Moves focus automatically to the close button. |

### ARIA enhancements

#### Internal **ARIA** that is managed by the component:

| ARIA                       | Usage                                                                                                    |
| -------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `role="status"`            | When content is populated or changed in `state="info"`, the component announces it unobtrusively.        |
| `role="alert"`             | When content is populated or changed in `state="warning/error"`, the component announces it immediately. |
| `aria-labelledby="IDREF"`  | References the accessible name.                                                                          |
| `aria-describedby="IDREF"` | References the accessible description.                                                                   |
| `aria-hidden="true"`       | State `icon` is hidden from the screen reader.                                                           |
| `aria-controls="IDREF"`    | Exposes relationship of close button.                                                                    |

## Development considerations

### Focus handling

To support **keyboard navigation**, please take care of correct **focus handling** after closing the `Banner` with `ESC`
or `Enter` key: The trigger element (e.g. a button) which has opened the `Banner` must receive focus state again after
the `Banner` is closed. This is important to keep focus order consistent.

### ARIA live announcements

The `Banner` component uses `role="status"` and `role="alert"` to announce **content changes** for assistive
technologies, but only if the component is **pre-rendered** and the content is added dynamically.
