## Usage

The following segment provides instructions for designers and developers regarding the appropriate utilization of this
component in various situations.

### Do:

- Use in forms when users need to enter and edit an amount of text that’s longer than a single line.
- Use the default Textarea type that includes a label as it's the most common and user-friendly way.
- Keep the label text short and descriptive (one or two words).
- Place validation text right below the Textarea box.
- Respect the min-height.
- Mark required fields with a red asterisk to improve the usability of forms.
- Use the Pure variant (without label) only if the context clearly describes the purpose.

### Don't:

- Don't use when text entry is expected to be short. Use an input instead to avoid confusing users.
- Don't overwhelm users with too many Textareas on a single page. Stick to no more than two Textareas.
