# Input Email <ComponentStatus tagName="p-input-email"></ComponentStatus>

The `p-input-email` component provides a user-friendly, accessible interface for entering valid email addresses. It
leverages native HTML5 email validation and ensures appropriate keyboard behavior on mobile devices. It includes `start`
and `end` slots to flexibly incorporate icons, buttons, or other elements within the input field.

A `label` is a caption which informs the user what information a particular form field is asking for. The
`p-input-email` component can be used with or without a label, but it's recommended to keep the label visible for better
accessibility whenever possible. When used without a label, it's mandatory to provide a descriptive label text for
screen readers.

While a `placeholder` is optional but recommended to be set whenever bits of example content or hints shall be shown to
give the user visual cues to fill out the form.
