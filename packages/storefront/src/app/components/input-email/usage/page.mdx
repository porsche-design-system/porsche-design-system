## Usage

The following segment provides instructions for designers and developers regarding the appropriate utilization of this
component in various situations.

`p-input-email` is specifically designed for collecting email addresses. It leverages built-in browser validation to
ensure that input follows the correct email format. This makes it a better choice than a generic text input when email
validation, proper keyboard behavior on mobile, and accessibility are important. For further guidance, see the
[MDN documentation on email inputs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/input/email#using_email_inputs).

### Do:

- Use when requesting an email address from the user.
- Use without a label only when the context is clear.
- Use for validation and error of input.
- Use asterisk for required fields.

### Don't:

- Don't use labels with more than two words whenever possible (keep it short and descriptive).
- Don't use an instructional or description text for the label.
