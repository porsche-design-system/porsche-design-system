## Usage

The following segment provides instructions for designers and developers regarding the appropriate utilization of this
component in various situations.

`p-input-email` is intended for freeform text input scenarios. It is suitable for entering names, addresses, or any other
non-restricted textual content. It should not be used where semantic or functional input types like numbers, emails,
or dates are more appropriate. In such cases, consider using a more specific input type or component optimized for that
data. For further guidance, see the
[MDN documentation on text inputs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/input/text#using_text_inputs).

### Do:

- Use when freeform text input is required or optional.
- Use without a label only when the context is clear.
- Use for validation and error of input.
- Use asterisk for required fields.

### Don't:

- Don't use labels with more than two words whenever possible (keep it short and descriptive).
- Don't use an instructional or description text for the label.
