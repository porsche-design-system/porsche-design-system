# Segmented Control <ComponentStatus tagName="p-segmented-control"></ComponentStatus>

The `p-segmented-control` component is similar to the native `select` element while showing all available options right
away.

It even behaves like a `select` where it can be controlled by setting the current value. However, it is not required and
you could purely rely on the change event.

Visually the `p-segmented-control` displays all options in equal size based on its largest option.

<Notification heading="Attention" heading-tag="h2" state="warning">
  When the <code>p-segmented-control</code> component is used within a form, it utilizes the
  <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/ElementInternals">ElementInternals</a> API, which has limited
  browser support.

Each option needs to be rendered by using a `p-segmented-control-item` child component where the `value` property is
**mandatory** in order to emit a useful change event.
