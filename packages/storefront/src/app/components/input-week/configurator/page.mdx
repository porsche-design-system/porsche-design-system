The `p-input-week` component provides a versatile, user‑friendly interface for entering week values. It supports
direct keyboard input, including arrow-key adjustments for precise changes. It has a start and end slot in order
to support flexible slotted content.

A `label` is a caption which informs the user what information a particular form field is asking for. The
`p-input-week` component can be used with or without a label, but it's recommended to keep the label visible for
better accessibility whenever possible. When used without a label, it's mandatory to provide a descriptive label text
for screen readers.
