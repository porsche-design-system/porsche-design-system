# Input Number <ComponentStatus tagName="p-input-number"></ComponentStatus>

The `p-input-number` component provides a versatile, user‑friendly interface for entering numeric values. It supports
direct keyboard input, increment/decrement controls for precise adjustments, and can optionally display a unit indicator
(e.g., `EUR`, `%`, `€`) alongside the value for clearer context in your UI.

<Notification heading="Attention" heading-tag="h2" state="warning">
  <code>p-input-number</code> is intended for true numeric input scenarios, especially when spinbutton increment and
  decrement controls enhance the user experience. It should not be used for values that merely happen to consist of
  digits — such as postal codes or credit card numbers. For those cases, consider using another input with an
  appropriate input mode. For further guidance, see the <Link href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/number#using_number_inputs">MDN documentation on number inputs</Link>.

A `label` is a caption which informs the user what information a particular form field is asking for. The
`p-input-number` component can be used with or without a label, but it's recommended to keep the label visible for
better accessibility whenever possible. When used without a label, it's mandatory to provide a descriptive label text
for screen readers.

While a `placeholder` is optional but recommended to be set whenever bits of example content or hints shall be shown to
give the user visual cues to fill out the form.

**Note:** Native `<input type="number">` elements are intended for true numeric input scenarios, especially when
spinbutton increment and decrement controls enhance the user experience. They should not be used for values that merely
happen to consist of digits—such as postal codes or credit card numbers. For those cases, consider using
`<input type="tel">` or another `<input>` type with an appropriate `inputmode` attribute.
For further guidance, see the [MDN documentation on number inputs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/number#using_number_inputs).
