## Basic example without preselection

To ensure the user makes a conscious choice, use the initial value `undefined` of the `value` property. If you want to
give the user the choice to deselect the current option, you can provide an option without a value
`<p-select-option></p-select-option>`. If you don't want the user to be able to deselect the current option, but still
want to show a placeholder text you can set the option `disabled` like this
`<p-select-option disabled>Please choose an option</p-select-option>`.

<ComponentExample codeSample={selectExampleRequired} />

## Slotted images

In order to show an icon for each option, you can optionally slot an `img` tag within the `p-select-option`. Be aware
that the `p-select-option` can only contain a `#text` and an `img` node.

## Form

The `p-select` component is a form-associated custom element that integrates seamlessly with forms. Leveraging the
[ElementInternals](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/ElementInternals) API, it functions similar to a
native select, ensuring compatibility with form behaviors. However, note that browser support for this API is limited.

When used within a form element, it's required to provide a name attribute to the `p-select` component. This attribute
establishes the link between the component and the form, enabling the selected value to be included in the form's data
when it's submitted.

<Notification heading="Attention" heading-tag="h2" state="warning">
  <code>p-select</code> does not use a native select internally. As a result, it lacks access to native{' '}
  <code>ValidityState</code>
  properties and <code>validationMessage</code>, and it cannot display the native validation popover. This means
  validation behavior and error display will need to be implemented separately if required.

## Controlled

In the controlled approach, the `p-select` component is externally controlled. Selecting an option triggers a custom
update event, allowing you to use the updated value. Internally, the value will be updated automatically but can be
overwritten by passing in a new value.

## Set Value

The `p-select` component behaves like regular form elements. It updates its value automatically based on user choices,
but can also be changed manually by using the value property. This property takes a string that represent the selected
option value.
