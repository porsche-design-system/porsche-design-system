# Input Time <ComponentStatus tagName="p-input-time"></ComponentStatus>

The `p-input-time` component provides a versatile, user‑friendly interface for entering time values. It supports direct
keyboard input, including arrow-key adjustments for precise changes. It has a start and end slot in order to support
flexible slotted content.

A `label` is a caption which informs the user what information a particular form field is asking for. The `p-input-time`
component can be used with or without a label, but it's recommended to keep the label visible for better accessibility
whenever possible. When used without a label, it's mandatory to provide a descriptive label text for screen readers.

While a `placeholder` is optional but recommended to be set whenever bits of example content or hints shall be shown to
give the user visual cues to fill out the form.

<FrameworkNotification showForFrameworks={['react']} heading="Input Event Handling">
  React's `onChange` behaves like the native `onInput` (fires on every keystroke). However, our web components follow
  standard browser behavior, where `onChange` only fires when the input loses focus. To get real-time updates on each
  keystroke, use `onInput` instead.
