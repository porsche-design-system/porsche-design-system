# Input Time <ComponentStatus tagName="p-input-time"></ComponentStatus>

The `p-input-time` component provides a versatile, userâ€‘friendly interface for entering time values. It supports
direct keyboard input, including arrow-key adjustments for precise changes. It has a start and end slot in order
to support flexible slotted content.

A `label` is a caption which informs the user what information a particular form field is asking for. The
`p-input-time` component can be used with or without a label, but it's recommended to keep the label visible for
better accessibility whenever possible. When used without a label, it's mandatory to provide a descriptive label text
for screen readers.

While a `placeholder` is optional but recommended to be set whenever bits of example content or hints shall be shown to
give the user visual cues to fill out the form.
