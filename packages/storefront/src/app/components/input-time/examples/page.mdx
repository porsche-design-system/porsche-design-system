## Form

The `p-input-time` can be integrated into a form in two ways: **controlled** or **uncontrolled**, depending on your
needs.

In the **controlled** approach, the input state is externally managed using the `value` property and `input` event to
keep it in sync with your application logic. This approach is ideal for complex forms or when using a form library. Note
that the component will still always update its internal value automatically when interacted with.

In the **uncontrolled** approach, the input behaves similar to a native `<input type="time" />`, automatically managing
its own state and including its value in form submissions through the
[ElementInternals](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/ElementInternals) API. This is convenient for
smaller forms or simple submissions.

For more details on form integration, refer to the `Form` section in the
[developing documentation](/developing/introduction) for your framework of choice, or find a full form integration
example in our [examples repository](https://github.com/porsche-design-system/examples/tree/v3/frameworks).

## Slots

Sometimes it's useful to be able to render markup (e.g. an anchor tag) for `label`, `description` or `message`.
Therefore, a named slot can be used. Make sure **not** to define the corresponding property on the host element when a
named slot is used (because a property definition is preferred over a named slot). For named slots only
[phrasing content](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/HTML/Content_categories#Phrasing_content) is
allowed.

In addition to the named slots `label`, `description` and `message`, there is also a `label-after` slot available. This slot must be used to render content after the label which is not directly part of it (e.g. an external link or a `popover` component).

If you need to provide additional information or actions to the user, you can use the `start` and `end` slots. For
example, you might include an icon, a unit, or an action button. Icons and text should use the `contrast-medium` color
to avoid being mistaken for a button.

If you use a `p-button-pure` or a `p-link-pure`, a `padding` and `margin` have to be set with the exposed
`--ref-p-input-slotted-padding` and `--ref-p-input-slotted-margin` CSS Variables.
