# Carousel <ComponentStatus tagName="p-carousel"></ComponentStatus>

The `p-carousel` component allows related or similar content to be consumed on a step by step basis with a better
overview than just showing them in a grid or as a list. The reason for this is, that only a certain amount of slides is
visible at the same time.

Therefore, the `p-carousel`'s content has to be divided into multiple parts or slides. The amount of slides visible can
be specified on a per-breakpoint basis.

<Notification heading="Layout hint" heading-tag="h2" state="warning">
  When using the <code>width</code> prop to align with the **[Porsche Grid](/styles/grid/)**, the component must span the full viewport width.

  When using the <code>--p-carousel-px</code> CSS variable, the component can be placed within any container, allowing you to customize the horizontal padding that reveals parts of the next/previous slide.

  When using the <code>--p-carousel-ps</code> and <code>--p-carousel-pe</code> CSS variables, the component can be placed within any container, allowing you to customize the horizontal padding asymmetric that reveals parts of the next/previous slide.
