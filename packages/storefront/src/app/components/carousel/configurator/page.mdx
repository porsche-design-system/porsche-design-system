# Carousel <ComponentStatus tagName="p-carousel"></ComponentStatus>

The `p-carousel` component allows related or similar content to be consumed on a step by step basis with a better
overview than just showing them in a grid or as a list. The reason for this is, that only a certain amount of slides is
visible at the same time.

Therefore, the `p-carousel`'s content has to be divided into multiple parts or slides.
The amount of slides visible can be specified on a per-breakpoint basis.

  The component can only be used with the full viewport width. The alignment of its content can be controlled
  by the <code>width</code> prop, which is in sync with the <b><Link href="/styles/grid/">Porsche Grid</Link></b>.
