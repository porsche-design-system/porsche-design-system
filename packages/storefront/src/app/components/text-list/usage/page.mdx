## Usage

The following segment provides instructions for designers and developers regarding the appropriate utilization of this
component in various situations.

### Do:

- Use to display short pieces of information in the form of an unordered or ordered list.
- Use an Unordered List to display content with equal value and an Ordered List for sequenced content.
- Arrange list items in a logical way such as from highest to the lowest level. If necessary split the content into
smaller and more specific categories and group them.
- Stick to a homogeneous writing structure and style within one list.

### Don't:

- Don't exceed two hierarchy levels in Text Lists.
- Don't mix active with passive voice or declarative with imperative sentences within one list.
