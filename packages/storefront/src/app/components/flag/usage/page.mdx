## Usage

The following guidelines provide instructions for designers and developers on the appropriate use of the `flag`
component for effective communication and user experience.

### Do:

- **Use the `flag` component for country identification.** The primary purpose is to represent a nation, such as
  specifying a user's country of origin, shipping location, or detailing product availability.

- **Pair the flag with a label for clarity.** While flags are great for quick visual recognition, they can be ambiguous.
  Always accompany a flag with a country name or an appropriate label to avoid confusion.

- **Use the two-letter ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 code.** This standard ensures consistency, reduces errors, and makes it easier
  to integrate with other systems and APIs.

### Don't:

- **Don't use flags to represent a language.** Many languages are spoken in multiple countries (e.g., Spanish). A flag
  represents a nation, not a language. Use language codes or names instead.

- **Don't use flags to represent an emotion or concept.** Flags are powerful symbols of national identity. Using them as
  generic icons can dilute their meaning and cause user confusion.

- **Don't rely solely on the flag icon.** Always provide an aria-label for accessibility. Screen readers cannot
  interpret flags, and without a descriptive label, you create an inaccessible user experience.
