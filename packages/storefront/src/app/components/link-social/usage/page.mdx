## Types

To ensure a seamless UX in all Porsche web applications it is recommended to use the Link Social as follows

| Variant        | Usage                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| -------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Icon and label | Due to better comprehensibility and accessibility, you should preferably go for this variant. The length of the link always adapts to the length of the label. As for the icon, you can either choose between one of the social platform icons provided in the Porsche icon set or also use a specific icon, whereas it must refer (which should be clear) to a social platform. |
| Icon only      | This variant contains an icon only with no further text information. It should preferably be used e.g. for social sharing links, when the user is totally aware of the button functionality due to a clear context.                                                                                                                                                              |
| Group          | The Link Social group contains the most used social icons that can be used as a group.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

## Usage

### Icon

The icon refers to the logo of the respective social platform. For the specific social icons the corresponding icon must
be used.

### Label

The label within a link should always be short and descriptive.

### Hover state

As for the social icons that are currently provided in the Porsche Design System, the background changes to the specific
corporate social platform color on hover. For specific social icons, for which no brand color is currently provided in
the Porsche Design System, a dark grey must be used as hover color instead (as defined for the standard
[Button](/components/button)/[Link](/components/link)).
