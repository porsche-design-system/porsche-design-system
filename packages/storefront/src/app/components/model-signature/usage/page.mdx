## Usage

The following segment provides instructions for designers and developers regarding the appropriate utilization of this
component in various situations.

### Do:

- Use signatures for emotional introduction and communication of model series.
- Consider using model signatures only occasionally, for example, within the Link Tile component for a specific model
line.
- Use model signatures as a subtle, larger background watermark, paired with appropriate visualization of vehicle detail
pages.
- Use as a headline-like element on model series overview pages.

### Don't:

- Avoid including signatures for specific derivatives such as a Panamera 4 Sport Turismo
- Platinum Edition or a 911 Targa 4S or in line with the text.
- The model signature should have sufficient spacing from the text.
- Avoid repeating the same model series signature within the interface.
- For example, do not display the 911 signatures twice or more in a viewport.
