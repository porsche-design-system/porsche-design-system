# Table <ComponentStatus tagName="p-table"></ComponentStatus>

<TableOfContents headings={["Caption","Layout: fixed","Column Headers","Advanced Table"]} />

## Caption

A caption that describes the content of the table can be set in two ways. It's mandatory to define a descriptive caption
to fulfill accessibility criteria.

### Via property

Using the `caption` property doesn't display the caption but instead can be used to improve accessibility of the table.

<ComponentStory story={tableStoryCaptionProperty} />

### Via slot

When using the `caption` slot its content will be rendered while offering full control of appearance.

<ComponentStory story={tableStoryCaptionSlot} />

## Layout: fixed

By setting `layout` to `fixed` you can get full control over every column width that are otherwise controlled by their
content. An identical `width`, `min-width` and/or `max-width` depending on what you want to achieve, has to be specified
on **every** `p-table-head-cell` and `p-table-cell` within the **same column**.

While it is possible to use relative `width` units likes `50%` or `50vw`, these may lead to unexpected results when the
table is scrollable especially on smaller screens or when combined with absolute (e.g. `50px`) or default auto values
(based on content).

If there is more content than available space, it will be overflowing, which you need to take care of, e.g. by using
`<p-text ellipsis>Some content</p-text>`.

  Since truncated content cannot be fully read, it is important to provide an alternative like a <code>title</code> attribute or custom tooltip.
</Notification>

<ComponentStory story={tableStoryLayoutFixed} />

## Column Headers

The `p-table`'s head can be configured by setting one or more of the following properties on each `p-table-head-cell`.

### Sorting

In order to have a sortable table column you need to provide the `sort` property.
It has the following structure:

```ts
type TableHeadCellSort = {
  id: string; // identifier for the column to be sorted by
  active: boolean;
  direction: 'asc' | 'desc';
};
```

Upon clicking a sortable `p-table-head-cell` element, the `p-table` emits an `update` event that you should subscribe
to.

<Notification heading="Deprecation hint" heading-tag="h4" state="warning">
  The <code>sortingChange</code> event has been deprecated and will be removed with the next major release.<br />
  Please use the <code>update</code> event instead.
</Notification>

### Hide Label

Sometimes you want to hide the label of a table column for example when the column's content is self-explanatory. This
can be achieved by setting the `hide-label` property.

<ComponentStory story={tableStoryHideLabel} />

## Advanced Table

The appearance of a table's contents can be customized as illustrated in the following example.
