# Table <ComponentStatus tagName="p-table"></ComponentStatus>

The `p-table` component displays tabular data and offers column-wise sorting options.
It combines a consistent appearance together with great accessibility while not having restrictions regarding its
content. Therefore, it can be used for plain text but also rich content like images, form elements and buttons.

It is a controlled component. This means it does not contain any internal state, and you got full control over its
behavior.

<Configurator tagName="p-table" story={tableStory} />
