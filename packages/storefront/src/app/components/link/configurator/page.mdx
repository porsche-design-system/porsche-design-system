# Link <ComponentStatus tagName="p-link"></ComponentStatus>

The `p-link` component is essential to perform changes in **page routes**. For an optimal user guidance and dedicated
pursuit of business or sales goals, different types of Links (**Primary** and **Secondary**) are available for usage. A
Link can be used with or without a label, but it's recommended to keep the **label visible** for better **usability**
whenever possible. When used without a label, it is mandatory for **accessibility** to provide a descriptive label text
for screen readers. In case you want the user to execute an action, you should select the [Button](components/button)
component instead.
