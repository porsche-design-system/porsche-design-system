The `p-content-wrapper` defines the outer spacings between the content area and the left and right screen sides, as well
as centering its content and setting a max-width.

<Notification heading="Deprecation hint" heading-tag="h2" state="error">
  This component is deprecated and will be removed with the next major release.
  In general, please use native <a href="https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid">CSS Grid</a> instead for better performance and more standardized layout technique.
  Additionally, we provide a <a href="/styles/grid/"><b>Porsche Grid</b></a> utility instead based on CSS Grid covering the specific layout needs for a harmonic appearance across all digital touch-points.

<Notification heading="Layout hint" heading-tag="h2" state="warning">
  The component can only be used with the full viewport width. The alignment of its content can be controlled
  by the <code>width</code> prop, which is in sync with the <b><a href="/styles/grid/">Porsche Grid</a></b>.<br /><br />
  Therefore, the following examples only work in fullscreen after clicking the <strong>Maximize</strong> buttons.
