# Button Pure <ComponentStatus tagName="p-button-pure"></ComponentStatus>

The `p-button-pure` component is essential to perform events for **interactions**. A Button can be used with or without
a label, but it's recommended to keep the **label visible** for better **usability** whenever possible. When used
without a label, it is mandatory for **accessibility** to provide a descriptive label text for screen readers.

Whenever you want to provide navigational elements, stick to the [Link](/components/link/) or
[Link Pure](/components/link-pure/) component instead.

Similarly to the `p-button`, the `p-button-pure` can be used as a submit button within a form for which a `name` and
`value` prop can be passed. See the [Button Form Example](/components/button/examples/#form) for more information.

You can use native `click`, `focus`, `focusin`, `blur` and `focusout` events on the `p-button-pure`.
