## Usage

The following segment provides instructions for designers and developers regarding the appropriate utilization of this
component in various situations.

### Do:

- Use Button Pure as a more subtle call to action or to execute an action.
- Choose the appropriate variant for your use case, such as Icon and Text or Text only.
- Use Icon left as the default state and stretch only on small viewports or areas.
- Keep the label short and include active verbs to indicate the action.
- Stack Button Pure groups left-aligned to guarantee scannability and legibility.

### Don't:

- Don't use Button Pure as the primary or only call to action.
- Don't use long labels that do not give a clear indication of the action.
- Don't use buttons to link/navigate to other pages. Use regular [Link](/components/link) instead.
