## Accessibility support

This component does not include any special accessibility features.

## Development considerations

### Heading hierarchy

While using the `Display` component, take care of the correct heading hierarchy which can be adjusted through the `tag`
property. Keep in mind that the visual appearance must not always be identical with the semantic hierarchy.

#### Best practices

- Use one unique `h1` per page that describes what that page is about.
- Use headings to describe the content below. Do not use an HTML heading just to make the text appear bigger or stand
  out.
- Use heading levels like the index of a book: hierarchical.
- Do not choose a heading by its size, but by its level in the context of the content.
- Heading hierarch should not increase by more than one level at a time.
- Do not skip a heading level from the top down.
