# Toast <ComponentStatus tagName="p-toast"></ComponentStatus>

The `p-toast` component manages both the queue and display of toast messages.
Therefore, you can only have a single instance of this component within in your application and its messages are
rendered on the `#top-layer` which ensures the element to be on top of the page, independent of where `p-toast` is
placed in the DOM hierarchy (z-index is not relevant anymore and won't have any effect).

Review the [notification decision tree](/patterns/notifications/decision-tree/) to determine which notification component
is best for a particular scenario.

Queuing messages on `p-toast` component happens via its `addMessage()` method.
For Angular users, we offer the injectable `ToastManager` service, for React, there is the `useToastManager()` hook.
Both expose the `addMessage()` method, which needs to be called with a parameter that has the following structure:

```ts
type ToastMessage = {
  text: string;
  state?: 'info' | 'success';
};
```

The bottom position of the `p-toast` can be adjusted via the `--p-toast-position-bottom` CSS variable.
