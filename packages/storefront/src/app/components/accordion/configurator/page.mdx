The `p-accordion` is a component that reveals or hides associated sections of content.
Accordions are flexible in the context and can include other components of the Porsche Design System.

It is a controlled component. This means it does not contain any internal state, and you got full control over its
behavior.

<Configurator tagName="p-accordion" story={accordionStory} slotStories={accordionSlotStories} />
