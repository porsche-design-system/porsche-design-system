# Theme

<TableOfContents headings={['Usage', 'Example']} />

We provide a custom theme for the [AG Grid library](https://ag-grid.com) for cases where a more sophisticated table is
required beyond the capabilities of our [p-table](/components/table/examples/) component. This theme is aligned with the
Porsche Design System's visual language and ensures consistency across your application.

The Porsche Design System AG Grid theme is based on the default AG Grid theme, `ag-theme-quartz`, and is available in
both light (default) and dark mode controlled by CSS `color-scheme`.

For more information on AG Grid's base themes, you can refer to the official
[AG Grid Themes documentation](https://ag-grid.com/javascript-data-grid/themes).

## Usage

#### 1. Import the Theme

First, import the Porsche Design System AG Grid theme into your application:

```js
import { pdsTheme } from '@porsche-design-system/components-{js|angular|react|vue}/ag-grid';
```

#### 2. Apply the Theme

You can apply the theme using one of the following methods:

1. Global Grid Options (Applies to all grid instances)

Use [global grid options](https://ag-grid.com/javascript-data-grid/grid-interface/#global-grid-options) to set the theme
globally:

```js
import { provideGlobalGridOptions } from 'ag-grid-community';

provideGlobalGridOptions({ theme: pdsTheme });
```

2. Individual Grid Options (Overrides global options):

Set the theme for a specific grid instance:

```js
const gridOptions = { theme: pdsTheme };
```

3. Component Prop Assignment

Pass the theme directly as a prop:

```tsx
<AgGridReact theme={pdsTheme} />
```

#### 3. Change the Theme Mode

By default, the Porsche Design System AG Grid theme uses a light color scheme. You can control the color scheme by
setting CSS `color-scheme: light;`, `color-scheme: dark;` or `color-scheme: light dark;` on any parent element of the
grid, such as the `<html>` or `<body>` tag.

**Available Modes:**

- Light Mode (default) → Set `color-scheme: light;` (optionally).
- Dark Mode → Set `color-scheme: dark;`.
- Auto Dark Mode → Set `color-scheme: light dark;`.

```html
<body style="color-scheme: light;"></body>
```
