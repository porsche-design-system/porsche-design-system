## Global Theme

All system colors are controlled via the CSS
[`color-scheme`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Reference/Properties/color-scheme) property and are
included in our mandatory [Global Styles](/styles/introduction). These styles also provide utility classes for selecting
the active theme and a polyfill to ensure compatibility with browsers that do not yet support `light-dark()` (see
[browser support](https://caniuse.com/mdn-css_types_color_light-dark)).

By default, color tokens use the light theme. To enable the dark theme or automatic theme switching based on system
settings, add the `.scheme-light`, `.scheme-dark` or `.scheme-light-dark` CSS class to the `<html>` element or any HTML
element. This applies the selected theme to all child elements.

Learn more in the [Theme](/must-know/theme) section.

## Prefixing

In case of a microservice architecture, multiple instances and versions of the Porsche Design System can be combined in
a final application. This could cause conflicts due to the way how custom web components are registered in the browser.
During the bootstrap phase of the Porsche Design System, custom elements are defined. If a second application wants to
register Porsche Design System again it will cause issues especially when different versions are used.

A way of preventing those conflicts is by using a unique custom prefix for the components. Simply pass your desired
prefix to the `prefix` property of `PorscheDesignSystemProvider`.

```tsx
// pages/App.vue

<script setup lang="ts">
  import AppComponent from './components/AppComponent.vue';
  import { PorscheDesignSystemProvider } from '@porsche-design-system/components-vue';
</script>

<template>
  <PorscheDesignSystemProvider prefix="sample-prefix">
    <AppComponent />
  </PorscheDesignSystemProvider>
</template>
```

In the following example the `PHeading` component will render as `<sample-prefix-p-heading>`.

```tsx
// AppComponent.vue

<script setup lang="ts">
  import { ref } from 'vue';
  import { PHeading } from '@porsche-design-system/components-vue';
</script>

<template>
  <PHeading>Heading</PHeading>
</template>
```
