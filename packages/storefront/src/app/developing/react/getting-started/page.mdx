## Quick start

To build your own application with the **React** components of Porsche Design System, follow these steps:

- Follow the instructions at (Introduction)[/developing/introduction] to get the required npm package
- Run `yarn create react-app my-app --template typescript` or `npx create-react-app my-app --template typescript` to
create a directory inside the current folder with the initial project structure called `my-app`
- To add TypeScript to your **Create React App**, you have to install it:

```bash
# install with yarn:
yarn add typescript @types/node @types/react @types/react-dom @types/jest

# install with npm:
npm install typescript @types/node @types/react @types/react-dom @types/jest
```

- Install the Porsche Design System

```bash
# install with yarn:
yarn add @porsche-design-system/components-react

# install with npm:
npm install @porsche-design-system/components-react
```

You are ready to start building your own application.

## Integration

The following project is a standard React (Create React App) setup extended by the necessary
`PorscheDesignSystemProvider` which you can import from `@porsche-design-system/components-react` :

```tsx
// index.tsx

import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
import { PorscheDesignSystemProvider } from '@porsche-design-system/components-react';
import './index.css';
import { App } from './App';

ReactDOM.render(
  <React.StrictMode>
    <PorscheDesignSystemProvider>
      <App />
    </PorscheDesignSystemProvider>
  </React.StrictMode>,
  document.getElementById('root')
);
```

Change your App file to use at least one Porsche Design System component, for example:

```tsx
// App.tsx

import { PHeading } from '@porsche-design-system/components-react';

export const App = (): JSX.Element => (
  <div className="App">
    <PHeading>Welcome to React</PHeading>
  </div>
);
```

Run `yarn start` or `npm start` and check if the components are displayed correctly.

<Notification heading="Attention" headingTag="h3" state="warning">
  Now, when you look at the result in your browser you should see an error message like
  "The Porsche Design System is used without using the `getInitialStyles()` partial".
  To fix this, you have to apply the [getInitialStyles() partial](/partials/initial-styles) which is mandatory since v3.7.0.

## When are Porsche Design System components initialized?

See [componentsReady()](/developing/components-ready) for further information.

## How do Porsche Design System components work in detail?

See [Initialization](/must-know/initialization/introduction) for further information.

## Sample integration

We provide a public GitHub repository with a basic sample project setup to show how it is managed in real code.
You can find the repository of the React example project here:
[Sample integration React](https://github.com/porsche-design-system/sample-integration-react)

### Get the project up and running

- Clone the repository by executing
`git clone https://github.com/porsche-design-system/sample-integration-react.git`
- Follow the installation guidelines in the `README.md` file
