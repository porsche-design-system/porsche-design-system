# Spacing

<TableOfContents headings={[]} />

## Usage

Fluid spacing scale up or down based on the size of the viewing device or browser window in a predefined range. This is
in contrast to using static spacing, which is set using a specific pixel value and does not scale.

### Do:

- Use the fluid spacers to ensure a smooth and proportional scaling of space between elements, groups, and sections that
  are aligned with the fluid typography and grid.
- Use "m" as the default space value since it corresponds to the grid-gap.
- Use values from "xs" to "l" for distances within a container, such as between heading, text, and buttons, or for
  spacing and grouping of form fields.
- Use values from "l" to "xxl" for spacing between sections on a page.

### Don't:

- Only use the static spacers when needed (e.g. within custom components).
- Don't use values outside the recommended range for specific types of spacing.
- Don't change the fluid spacer manually based on different viewports.
