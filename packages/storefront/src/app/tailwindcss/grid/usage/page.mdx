# Grid

<TableOfContents headings={[]} />

## Usage

The following segment provides instructions for designers and developers regarding the appropriate utilization of this
style in various situations.

**Basic-Grid 12 Columns:** This is the default and should contain all productive content, such as copy, graphics, and
descriptive imagery (or at least the main focus of the image).

**Extended-Grid 14 Columns:** Containers and images can be stretched to the extended grid to cluster content better or
create a more immersive moment.

**Wide-Grid 16 Columns:** Productive applications with, for example, a sidebar, can make use of the wide grid. Further
interactive/productive modules can make use of the full 16 columns.

**Full-bleed:** For immersive moments, images and background colors can be stretched to the full width of the viewport.
This does not correspond to the grid.

**Note:** that the Basic-, Extended-, and Wide-Grid all equal 6 columns on mobile viewports.

### Do:

- Use the grid for a consistent appearance over all touchpoints.
- Align all left-aligned-headlines on one vertical line (left border of basic-grid).
- Set at least the image focus for larger imagery within the basic grid.

### Don't:

- Don't scale elements within the grid bigger than the maximum specification for 1920px.
