# Notifications

<TableOfContents headings={["When to use","Types/Behavior","Layer order","References"]} />

Notifications are an important method of communicating with users and providing feedback.

Their main aim should be to help users perform a task and not necessarily interfere or get in the way of users while
using your product. Ensure your **notifications are relevant, timely, and informative.**

**Keep in Mind:** Highly frequented or disruptive Notifications can have a **negative impact** on the user's experience.

## When to use

In order to find the right notification type for your use case, we have defined some decision-making rules for you:

## Types/Behavior

| Components                            | Placement            | Follow-up Action | Hide               | Criticality | States                           |
| ------------------------------------- | -------------------- | ---------------- | ------------------ | ----------- | -------------------------------- |
| **Form elements (Inline Validation)** | Below form element   | Yes              | Resolved           | Low         | Success, Error                   |
| **Toast**                             | Bottom, Left         | No               | Automatically (6s) | Low/Medium  | Neutral, Success                 |
| **Inline Notification**               | Before/After Content | Yes              | Resolved/Dismiss   | Medium      | Neutral, Success, Warning, Error |
| **Banner**                            | Top, Center          | Yes              | Resolved/Dismiss   | Medium/High | Neutral, Warning, Error          |
| **Modal**                             | Center               | Yes              | Resolved/Dismiss   | High        | Neutral, Warning, Error          |

## Layer order

**Important:** All elements are rendered on the browsers `#top-layer` so a manual ordering of z-index will
have no effect, instead the browser renders the element on top of everything which was triggered to be shown last, [meet the top layer: a solution to z-index:10000](https://developer.chrome.com/blog/what-is-the-top-layer).
