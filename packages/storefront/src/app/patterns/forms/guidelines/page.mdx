# Forms

Forms are an essential component for gathering information from users or allowing them to configure options.
Well-designed forms enhance user experience and are crucial for brand reputation. The perfect combination of structure,
form elements, labels, help, and feedback are necessary for creating effective forms and increasing conversions. Common
cases for form use include account login or registration, contact forms, checkout processes, setting configuration, and
surveys.

Porsche web applications should follow a basic structure consisting of form fields, labels, good feedback, and
call-to-actions. The labels should be short and descriptive, while the call-to-action buttons should be emphasized and
have clear labels, informing users about what to expect.

## Tips for Designing User-Centric Forms:

- Only ask for relevant information.
- Start with easy-to-fill fields first.
- Pre-fill or auto-detect information whenever possible.
- Keep the form intuitive and logical.
- Auto-focus the first field by default.
- Automating actions when possible (e.g. autocorrect, autocomplete).
- Provide the correct input type.
- Avoid placeholder text.
- Explain all options for action to the user.
- Make the form scannable and avoid visual hurdles.
- Split long processes into multi-step forms.
- Provide help only when necessary.
- Always provide status information.
- Provide extra information when needed, but hide it in an "information" icon.
- Ask for as little sensitive and personal information as possible.
- Give deeper information on a specific input, if necessary.

## Tips for a Effective Form Layout:

- **Headline and subline:** Use a clear title to inform the user about the form's purpose and what to expect when
filling it out.
- **Sections:** Divide longer forms into content-related sub-areas to improve scannability. Fieldsets with informative
titles help create a logical order. This decision is based on the Gestalt psychology principle of proximity, which
suggests that objects that are near each other tend to be grouped together.
- **Call-to-actions:** Place them left-aligned to ensure consistency and ease of use.
- **Single-column layout:** Use it for better scanning, especially for mobile or longer forms. This decision is based on
a research study that found that single-column forms could be completed 15.4 seconds faster than comparable
multi-column forms, at a 95% confidence level (CXL Institute, 2018). The common reading direction is zigzag ("Z"),
which makes it harder to perceive a multi-column form.
- **Form layout spacings:** Cluster the form in logical, coherent parts using our fluid-spacer. This decision is based
on the Gestalt psychology principle of proximity.
- **Form field widths:** Set to full form width by default to minimize the fluttering effect. Use estimated form field
lengths for select or radio button groups, multiple form fields in a row, or very short forms. This decision is based
on the goal of striking a balance between reflecting the intended content length and visual appeal.

## Tips for Effective Form Validation:

- Mark required fields with a red asterisk.
- Validate input fields directly after losing focus.
- Display inline validation feedback below input fields.
- Scroll to the first error field and set focus on it when a user tries to submit a form with an error.
- Consider including an error summary at the top of the form for required groups of fields.
- For radio button and checkbox groups, mark the fieldset as required to display a group error message.

---

## Tips for Writing Effective Error Messages:

- Keep error messages clear and simple, avoiding technical terms or abbreviations.
- Offer a solution that allows users to repeat a step or try another route.
- Consider the user's frustration and aim to absorb it with humor or clarity, but avoid going too far.
- Display the message below the form field and remove it after correction.
- The following questions should be answered to create a good error message: What was the user doing? Why did the error
occur? How can they proceed?
- If no immediate solution, offer alternatives like support contact.

**Common reasons for errors:**

- input incorrectly formatting data
- leaving a mandatory field blank
- leaving a mandatory field incomplete

## Writing examples

### Credit card number is incorrect

**Instead of saying**
_Invalid input_

**Describe the problem**
_Numbers are missing in your credit card number._

**Offer a solution**
_Numbers are missing in your credit card number. Please check your input._

**Add a human touch**
_Is the card number complete? Please check your input._

---

### Mandatory free text input field is not filled

**Instead of saying**
_This field is obligatory._

**Describe the problem**
_Please enter your message._

**Add a human touch**
_What would you like to tell us?_

---

### Server error on website

**Instead of saying**
Service not available. The server is temporarily busy. Please try again later.

**Describe the problem**
_Unfortunately, we can’t load the site because of a problem with our server._

**Offer a solution**
_Unfortunately, we can’t load the site because of a problem with our server. Try again later or visit another site:_

- Porsche Website
- My Porsche
- Porsche Shop

**Add a human touch**
_Not our claim to performance. Unfortunately, we can’t load the site because of a problem with our server. Try again
later or visit another site, while we’re working on a solution:_

- Porsche Website
- My Porsche
- Porsche Shop

### **Prevent errors**

Your microcopy might even help in preventing errors, e.g. by telling a user as clear as possible what format and input
is required for a certain input field. E.g. List the necessary characters that a password must contain.

## Accessibility

Always stick to the defined [Accessibility criteria](/must-know/accessibility) (WCAG level AA) when designing web
applications for Porsche. For form design you should consider in particular the following aspects:

- Forms should **provide 100% keyboard navigation**, which means: Users should be able to jump through the whole form
using the tab key.
- Always **provide focus states** to show the user both the starting and when proceeding the current position. The
Porsche Design System form components are provided with a focus state on board.
- **Never use color as a single indicator for a type of use or state**. In form layout, this means that for error or
success notifications and for highlighting incorrect form fields it's highly recommended to work with further
formatting, e.g. a larger border width. This is also already predefined in the Porsche Design System form components.
- **Provide a sufficient click/touch area** for each component.
[Apple’s Human Interface Guidelines](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/ios/visual-design/adaptivity-and-layout)
suggest providing a tappable area of 44 x 44 px for all controls. As this "safe zone" might result in large spacings
between components (just think of a stacked checkbox list) or overlapping of the tappable areas, we'd recommend
defining the tappable area component-based, as the size of the tappable area is also a matter of the general height
_and_ width of a component. You'll find detailed information in the respective component guidelines.
