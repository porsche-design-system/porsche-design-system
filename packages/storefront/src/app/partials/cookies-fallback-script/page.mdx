# Cookies Fallback Script

<TableOfContents headings={["Supported options","Examples","Translations","Troubleshooting"]} />

**Function name:** `getCookiesFallbackScript()`

Although the Porsche Design System does not rely on browser cookies, a blocking overlay is shown asking the user to
activate browser cookies in case those are disabled completely.

Therefore, we provide a ready to use partial in all `@porsche-design-system/components-{js|angular|react|vue}` packages
which needs to be injected before the closing `</body>` of your `index.html`.

<CookiesFallbackButton />

## Supported options

| Option   | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | Type                        | Default |
| -------- |------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------| --------------------------- | ------- |
| `cdn`    | Decides from which CDN the resources are loaded.                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | `'auto' \| 'cn'`             | `'auto'` |
| `format` | Defines the output format of the partial. By default, it returns a html string. For `jsx` it returns a jsx element. For `sha256` it returns a SHA-256 hash of the innerHTML to use in a [Content Security Policy (CSP)](/must-know/security/content-security-policy/). | `'html' \| 'jsx' \| 'sha256'` | `'html'` |

When using `jsx` in the `format` option, it is necessary to have `react/jsx-runtime` as a dependency in the project
included.

## Examples

Project integration differs based on the project setup.
The following showcases the most common ways.

<PartialDocs name="getCookiesFallbackScript" location="body" partialCalls={[
    {
      params: []
    },
    {
      comment: 'Alternative: Force using China CDN',
      params: [
        {
          key: 'cdn',
          value: 'cn',
        }
      ]
    }
  ]}
/>

## Translations

Automatic translations for the following languages are provided:
`'de' | 'ru' | 'fr' | 'en' | 'it' | 'pt' | 'es' | 'ja' | 'ko' | 'zh' | 'nl' | 'pl' | 'cs' | 'da' | 'et' | 'fi' | 'lt' | 'lv' | 'no' | 'sl' | 'sv' | 'tr' | 'uk'`

As soon as the **Cookies Fallback** script initializes, it looks for the obligatory `lang` attribute defined in the
`html` tag. Support is given for the following formats, e.g.:

- `lang="en"`
- `lang="en_US"`
- `lang="en-US"`

If none of these languages can be found, it will fall back to `en`.

## Troubleshooting

There always might be a case where something goes wrong. Here are some possible answers:

1. **Q:** Why does the translation not get recognized automatically?
**A:** Mostly this is a result of false order of script loading and setting translation key by the application. It's
required that the `lang` attribute in the `html` tag is defined with the correct value **before** the **Cookies
Fallback** script gets initialized.
**A:** The translation key is not part of the provided keys (see "Translations")
**A:** The translation key has not the correct format (see "Translations")
2. **Q:** Why are there no implementation guidelines for my JS framework?
**A:** Implementing a third party script can be done in many ways regarding the setup of your application. So there
isn't a solely true way to integrate it in a specific framework. Just one rule of thumb: **It should be initialized
as late as possible.**
