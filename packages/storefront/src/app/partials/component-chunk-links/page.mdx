# Component Chunk Links

<TableOfContents headings={["Supported options","Examples"]} />

**Function name:** `getComponentChunkLinks()`

Porsche Design System components load dynamically from a CDN as soon as they are used for the first time.
This results in a waterfall like loading behaviour where your application bootstraps first, then loads the Porsche
Design System Core and when any component rendered the corresponding component chunk gets loaded afterwards.
This can be optimized by fetching used chunks in parallel while the application is bootstrapping.

Therefore, we provide a ready to use partial in all `@porsche-design-system/components-{js|angular|react|vue}` packages
which needs to be injected into the `<head>` of your `index.html`.

An in-depth optimization guide can be found at
[Vanilla Js Optimization](/must-know/initialization/vanilla-js#optimization).

## Supported options

| Option       | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                        | Type                           | Default |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------ | ------- |
| `components` | All components listed in the array are loaded from the CDN. By default, our core is always preloaded when using this partial.                                                                                      | <code>({COMPONENT_CHUNK_NAMES.map((x) => `'${x}'`).join(' \| ')})[]</code> | `[]`    |
| `cdn`        | Decides from which CDN the resources are loaded.                                                                                                                                                                   | `'auto' \| 'cn'`               | `'auto'` |
| `format`     | Defines the output format of the partial. By default, it returns a html string, with `jsx` it returns valid jsx elements. When using the `js` option a javascript object is returned. | `'html' \| 'jsx' \| 'js'`  | `'html'` |

When using `jsx` in the `format` option, it is necessary to have `react/jsx-runtime` as a dependency in the project
included.

## Examples

Project integration differs based on the project setup.
The following showcases the most common ways.

**Note:** Make sure to preload only component chunks which are really needed initially!
