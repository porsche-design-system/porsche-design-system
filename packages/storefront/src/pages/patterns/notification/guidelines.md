# Notifications

Notifications are an important method of communicating with users and providing feedback. 

Their main aim should be to help users perform a task and not necessarily interfere or get in the way of users while using your product. Ensure your **notifications are relevant, timely, and informative.** 

**Keep in Mind:**
Highly frequented or disruptive Notifications can have a **negative impact** on the usersâ€™ experience.
