# Dear friends of great design!  

Welcome to the Porsche UI Kit - the Porsche initiative to unite every digital Porsche product around a common Porsche Design System and Language. We want to support everyone who is working on digital products for Porsche by a qualitative and brand-aligned collection of design elements with complemented guidance.

The Porsche UI Kit contains all the fundamental styles and pattern-based components to build aesthetic and intuitive designs for Porsche products. Both for designers providing Sketch Libraries and for Developers with reusable React Components or plain HTML and SCSS partials. All created and tested with Porsche quality standards, following a unified design language and the global Porsche Corporate Design principles.

## Our Principles
We foster trust and responsibility rather than policing; Sticking to a continuous evolvement strategy with open collaboration and contribution.

* Use the contents as ingredients for building creative designs - upon and combining them
* Strive for a deep alignment between design and code through a close collaboration and communication
* See continuous updating as operation task and avoid growing debts
* Join our communication channels and community rituals to receive and share information
* Participate in the evolvement with your contribution and feedback
