# Dear friends of great design!  

Welcome to Porsche UI - the Porsche initiative to unite digital design at Porsche around a common system with a shared language, tools and partials. We want to empower everyone who is working on digital products for Porsche by a qualitative and brand-aligned collection of design elements with complemented guidance and supporting working methods.

The Porsche UI Kit contains all the fundamental styles and pattern-based components to build aesthetic, familiar and consistent designs for Porsche products. Ready to use both as Sketch Libraries and reusable React Components or compiled HTML and CSS. Everything centrally pre-built and tested with Porsche quality standards and following the global Porsche Corporate Design.

## Benefits

**Ship faster and focus on value.**  
Use the Porsche UI Kit stops wasting time on repetitive work and creation of what's already existing. Additionally the organization, documentation and methods around, enable faster releases and quick iterations. Design capacity can be focused on more value results and solving the hard design problems.

**Better user experience.**  
Reuse the pre-built essential design elements increases a consistent look and feel across different products, platforms and disciplines. Repetitive design patterns within the products that match the marketing measures improves the familarity, brand awareness and the overall experience for the user.

**Quality for the long term.**  
A designated built and managed design system with standardised components and unified toolings pays off in clean code and design results. 

**Laverage knowledge and clarity.**  
With all teams having access to the system and using the same language, it is much easier to collaborate and share knowledge with a clear understanding. Also the onboarding of new members is much easier and faster.
