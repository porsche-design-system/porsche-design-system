# Welcome to the Porsche UI Kit

Our goal is to empower teams and partners globally to create great digital experiences together, that feel like beeing designed by one team. By uniting everyone around a common organisation with shared design tools, methods and components. With enough flexibility of individualisation for various contexts.
 
The Porsche UI Kit provides the fundamental elements to build aesthetic, quialitative and intuitive designs. Ready to use as designed Sketch Libraries, coded React Components or simple CSS with compiled HTML. Everything built and tested following the Porsche Quality Standards and Corporate Design.

## Benefits for Business, Design and Development

**Ship faster and focus on value.**  
Using the Porsche UI Kit stops wasting time on repetitive work and creation of what's already existing. The complementing guidance and workin methods, enable faster releases and quick iterations. Design capacity can be focused on valuable results and solving real design problems.

**Better user experience.**  
Reusing the pre-built essential design elements increases a consistent look and feel across different products, platforms and disciplines. Repetitive design patterns within the products, that match the marketing measures, improve the familarity, brand awareness and overall experience for the user.

**Quality for the long term.**  
A centrally built continuously maintained design system with standardised components and unified toolings pays off in clean and qualitative code and design results. All innately meeting the latest technical requirements and standards of accesibility, performance and usability.

**Laverage knowledge and clarity.**  
With all teams having access to the system and using the same language, it is much easier to collaborate and share knowledge with a clear understanding. Also the onboarding of new members is much easier and faster.
