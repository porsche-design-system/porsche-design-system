# React - Sample integration

You can find the repository of the react example project here: [Sample integration react](https://github.com/porscheui/sample-integration-react.git)

---

## Get the project up and running
* Clone the repository by executing <br>
`git clone https://github.com/porscheui/sample-integration-react.git`

### yarn
* Install dependencies via `yarn install`
* Run tests via `yarn test`
* Run the application via `yarn start`
* Build the application via `yarn build`

### npm
* Install dependencies via `npm install`
* Run tests via `npm test`
* Run the application via `npm start`
* Build the application via `npm run build`

---

## Reproduce on your own
To build your own application which is provided with the Porsche Design System follow these simple steps:

* Run `yarn create react-app my-app --template typescript` or `npx create-react-app my-app --template typescript` to create a directory inside the current 
folder with the initial project structure called `my-app` 
* To add TypeScript to your **Create React App**, you have to install it:
```
// install with yarn:
yarn add typescript @types/node @types/react @types/react-dom @types/jest

// install with npm:
npm install typescript @types/node @types/react @types/react-dom @types/jest
```
* Install the Porsche Design System  

``` 
// install with yarn:
yarn add @porsche-design-system/components-react

// install with npm:
npm install @porsche-design-system/components-react
```

You are ready to start building your own application.

The following project is a standard React Scripts (Create React App) setup:

### Index file
``` 
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
import './index.css';
import App from './App';
import * as serviceWorker from './serviceWorker';

ReactDOM.render(
  <React.StrictMode>
    <App />
  </React.StrictMode>,
  document.getElementById('root')
);

serviceWorker.unregister();
``` 

### App file

Change your App file to use at least one Porsche Design System Component, for example:

``` 
import React from 'react';
import { PHeadline } from '@porsche-design-system/components-react';

export function App() {
  return (
    <div className="App">
      <PHeadline variant="headline-1">Headline from Porsche Design System</PHeadline>
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

Run `yarn start` or `npm start` and check if the components are displayed correctly.

## Test the application

**Jest** uses **jsdom**. It is not yet possible to render web components via jsdom. 

To ensure your tests don't fail, we provide mocks for every Porsche Design System component. 
They are distributed in the `@porsche-design-system/components-react` npm package.

To consume the mocks you can set them up via your **setupTest.ts** file in your root folder and copy the following snippet into the setup file.

```
// setupTest.ts

jest.mock('@porsche-design-system/components-react', () => {
    return require('@porsche-design-system/components-react/mocks');
});
```
You have to access the mocks in the Mock-Factory of the `jest.mock()` function. We have to use `require` because the mock factory doesn't allow otherwise. 

If you only need a single component mock you can also consume the mock directly in your test. All of our mocks are named like **p-name-mock** for example **p-headline-mock**.

```
// SingleComponent.tsx

export function SingleComponent() {
    return (
        <PHeadline>Some headline</PHeadline>
    )
}
```

```
// SingleComponent.test.tsx

jest.mock('@porsche-design-system/components-react', () => {
    return require('@porsche-design-system/components-react/mocks/p-headline-mock');
});

test('renders a headline from Porsche Design System', async () => {
    const {getByText} = render(<SingleComponent/>);
    const headLineElement = getByText('Some headline');
    expect(headLineElement).toBeInTheDocument();
});
```

Use this solution until **Creat React App** upgrades to a newer **jsdom** version which provides support for **Web Components**.
In the meantime we keep providing mocks.
 
You find detailed information on how to use mock functions in **Jest** [here](https://jestjs.io/docs/en/mock-functions.html).
   
We also provide test examples in our [sample integration project](https://github.com/porscheui/sample-integration-react/blob/master/src/tests/App.test.tsx).
