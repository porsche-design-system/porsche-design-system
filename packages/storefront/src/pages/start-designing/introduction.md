## Start Designing

The Porsche Design System enables designers to create outstanding digital designs by using the pre-built libraries, styles and templates - fast and high-quality. If you are working for a digital product of Porsche we are happy to invite you to our UX onboarding process and tell you more about our culture of designing great digital experiences and give you access to all of our tools, methods and communication channels:

## 1. Tooling
To improve output efficiency and reduce maintenance costs, at Porsche we decided to set the tools [Sketch](https://www.sketch.com/) and [Abstract](https://www.goabstract.com/) as standard for designing. Please install the latest [Abstract desktop app](https://app.goabstract.com/). 

You can find a [detailed guideline on how to use Abstract here](start-designing/design-workflow)

## 2. Get inspired 
After you received your Abstract invitation you can get a smooth and easy onboarding experience. You are welcome to have a look into other digital Porsche projects within our [Porsche Abstract Organisation](https://app.abstract.com/organizations/bc37bb03-3469-4b15-99a2-60dbec187bce/projects) and use them as a starting point.

## 3. Layout setup
There's no need to design from scratch anymore! Instead, you can use our pre-built Sketch layout templates. They contain artboards in all relevant responsive screen sizes enriched by the right layout and grid presets (which can be turned visible via: View → Canvas → Show Layout).

## 4. Sketch libraries and resources
The components of the Porsche Design System are provided in two Sketch libraries that can be easily linked with Sketch by clicking on the following RSS library links. Once linked, Sketch will automatically check for updates. 

### Basic Library 
The basic library contains the design fundamentals such as typography, colours and icons.  
[Download Porsche Design System Basic](sketch://add-library?url=https%3A%2F%2Fdesignsystem.porsche.com%2Fporsche-design-system-basic.sketch.xml) 

### Web Library
The web library provides components like buttons, form elements and many more that can be used within web applications.  
[Download Porsche Design System Web](sketch://add-library?url=https%3A%2F%2Fdesignsystem.porsche.com%2Fporsche-design-system-web.sketch.xml)

Please be aware of the used library version (Sketch: Preferences → Libraries) and coordinate with your developer counterpart to be aligned on the version you're using.

### Porsche Next font
In order to design Porsche web applications and to use the Porsche Design System libraries properly, you have to download and install the [Porsche Next font](https://cdn.ui.porsche.com/porsche-design-system/font/v2/Porsche_Next_WebOTF_Lat-Gr-Cyr.zip).
