# Initial Styles
**Function name:** `getInitialStyles()`

If you use `Porsche Design System` components, we take care that your application only renders those if they are fully styled.
However, it takes a moment until our core is fully loaded and only then we can take action. This short timespan has to be covered.

Therefore, we provide a ready to use partial in all `@porsche-design-system/components-{js|angular|react}` packages which needs to be injected into the `<head>` of your `index.html`.

## Supported options
- **prefix:** `string = ''`
- **withoutTags:** `boolean = false`

## Examples

Project integration differs based on the project setup.  
The following showcases the most common ways.
