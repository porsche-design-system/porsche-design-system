## What is Accessibility

When we say a digital product is **accessible** we mean that its content is available to, and its functionality can be
operated by, literally anyone. For **creators of digital products**, it's frivolous to assume that all users can see and
use a keyboard, mouse or touch screen, and can interact with the page content the same way they do. This can lead to an
experience that works well for those people but **creates issues** which range from simple annoyances to absolute
horrible user experiences.

Accessibility refers to the experience of users who might be outside the narrow scope of the "typical" user, and who
might access or interact with things differently than you expect. Specifically, we are talking about more than **15% of
worldwide users who have some type of impairment or disability**.

For example, although we tend to centre our discussion of accessibility on users with **physical impairments**, we can
all relate to the experience of using an interface that is not accessible to us for other reasons. Have you ever had a
problem using a desktop site on a mobile phone, or seen the message "This content is not available in your area", or
couldn't read a text because the font-size and contrast were too low? Those are all **accessibility issues** we have to
face and find **practical solutions** for.

## Why it matters

As maintainers of the **Porsche Design System**, we always want the **best experience for all users** and provide best
in class solutions for our customers. And this includes **accessibility**. There are several overall benefits to anyone
who uses accessible products:

- **Better user experience** for everyone
- **Better SEO** (Search Engine Optimization)
- **Better performance** (e.g. faster loading times)
- **Better maintainability** (e.g. less code)
- **Better compatibility** (e.g. with assistive technologies)
- **Better brand image** (e.g. more trust)
- **Better business** (e.g. more customers)
- **Better legal compliance** (e.g. avoiding lawsuits)
