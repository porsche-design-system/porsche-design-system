# Contribution

Porsche UI Kit is used by many teams and should be also maintained by many teams.

â€¦but until the release of version 1.0.0 of Porsche UI Kit, which is a complete rewrite, we can't grant access to the GitHub repository. We will define a workflow for contributors who want to design and develop new components. As soon as we have set up a collaboration workflow we will inform you in the Slack channel.
