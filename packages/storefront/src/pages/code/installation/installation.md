# Installation

The release of the first stable version `v1` of Porsche UI Kit is planned by the end of Q2/2019. Beta-releases might be available earlier. The new version will contain refactored, optimized and tested *React components* as well as pure *HTML/CSS patterns*.
**We'll update this installation guide as soon as `v1` is finally released.**
