# Porsche Design System

## V3 Status

### Common

- Use `px` instead of `rem` apart from `font-size`
- Use `hostHiddenStyles` in all components
- No `:active` style shall be set
- Use `text-indent: -999999px` for accessible but hidden text/label
  (https://webaim.org/techniques/css/invisiblecontent/)
- Ensure Banner, Toast, Modal, Content-Wrapper etc. is in sync with new grid design token by VRT test
- Markdown Styles needs to be updated with new design tokens
- enable ssr wrapper markup snapshot tests
- generic test für `:host([hidden])` of all components
- generic test for `display: xy !important` of all components
- optimize component chunking

Maybe it's an WebKit/Linux thing?<br />- If "close" button is placed above image the contrast in `:hover` state can be to low (especially on dark images).
