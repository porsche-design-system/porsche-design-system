# Introduction

## Install

We provide different partials to inform the user about supported browsers and/or not supported browser configuration like disabled cookies.
Partials are utility functions that return static code or markup that is very dynamic (e.g. contains hashed file names).

The partials are provided in the `@porsche-design-system/browser-notification` package.

It's necessary to have access to the Porsche Design System private npm registry to be able to install the `@porsche-design-system/browser-notification` npm package. 
If you don't have an account yet, please first [read more about getting started as developer](start-coding/introduction).

```
// install with npm:
npm install @porsche-design-system/browser-notification

// install with yarn:
yarn add @porsche-design-system/browser-notification
```
