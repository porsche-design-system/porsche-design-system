## What is Accessibility
When we say a digital product is **accessible** we mean that its content is available to, and its functionality can be operated by, literally anyone.
For **creators of digital products**, it's frivolous to assume that all users can see and use a keyboard, mouse or touch screen, and can interact with the page content the same way they do. 
This can lead to an experience that works well for those people but **creates issues** which range from simple annoyances to absolute horrible user experiences.

Accessibility refers to the experience of users who might be outside the narrow scope of the "typical" user, and who might access or interact with things differently than you expect.
Specifically, we are talking about more than **15% of worldwide users who have some type of impairment or disability**.

For example, although we tend to centre our discussion of accessibility on users with **physical impairments**, we can all relate to the experience of using an interface that is not accessible to us for other reasons. 
Have you ever had a problem using a desktop site on a mobile phone, or seen the message "This content is not available in your area", or couldn't read a text because the font-size and contrast were too low? Those are all **accessibility issues** we have to face and find **practical solutions** for.

## Why it matters
As maintainers of the **Porsche Design System**, we always want the **best experience for all users**. You might argue that due to the fact that "blind people don't drive", we do not need to give support to visually impaired people. But this is a very short-sighted point of view.
Just think about all the **services** Porsche offers around the car that has nothing to do with driving itself. Or think about people which have a "simple" red-green color blindness (about 10% of all humans). 
Or what about the average age of the target audience of Porsche customers? It's an average of 55 years! As you can see, **Web Accessibility is for all users**, not just blind people.

And due to compliance, Porsche as a global company needs to **support Web Accessibility by law** in certain regions.

## How we can do better
At Porsche, we are **driven by excellence**, and the **Porsche Design System** is committed to deliver highly **usable and accessible** components that are not limited to certain users or use cases.
The **Design System Components** are tested automatically and manually against the most important official ruleset of [WCAG 2.1 (AA)](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/).

You can find **accessibility specific documentation** on component level marked with <A11yIcon size="small"></A11yIcon>.
