## The "What"
When we say a site is accessible we mean that the site's content is available to, and its functionality can be operated by, literally anyone (this includes non-human visitors to your site, e.g. search engine robots too).
For developers/designers, it's easy for them to assume that all users can see and use a keyboard, mouse or touch screen, and can interact with the page content the same way they do. 
This can lead to an experience that works well for those people but creates issues which range from simple annoyances to show-stoppers.

Accessibility relates to the experience of users who might be outside of the narrow range of the "typical" user, and who might access or interact with things differently than you expect. 
Specifically, it concerns users experiencing some type of impairment or disability – and bear in mind that such an experience might be non-physical or temporary.

For example, although we tend to centre our discussion of accessibility on users with physical impairments, we can all relate to the experience of using an interface that is not accessible to us for other reasons. 
Have you ever had a problem using a desktop site on a mobile phone, or seen the message "This content is not available in your area", or couldn't read a text because the font-size and contrast were to low? Those are all accessibility issues we have to face and find practical solutions.

## The "Why"
As maintainers of the Porsche Design System, we always want the best experience for all users. You might argue that, as an OEM in the automotive sector, we do not need to give support to visually impaired people. But this is a very short-sighted point of view.
Just think about all the services Porsche wants to offer around the car that has nothing to do with driving itself. Or think about people which have a "simple" red-green color blindness (about 10% of all humans). 
Or what about the average age of the target audience of Porsche customers? It's an average of 55 years! As you can see, Web Accessibility is for all users, not just blind people.

And last but not least Porsche as a global company needs to support Web Accessibility by law.

## The "How"
At Porsche we are driven by excellence and we have the approach to deliver highly usable and accessible components that are not limited to certain users or use cases. They should work everywhere and for everyone! 
That's why we develop and offer high-quality, standardized and accessible components for all possible environments and use cases which are compliant with and tested against the most important official ruleset of [WCAG 2.1 (AA)](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/).

To avoid possible [**violations against country-specific law**](accessibility/compliance) (e.g. ADA in the U.S.) we highly recommend following our guidelines to gather more accessibility in your projects.

To integrate accessibility into your product workflow, follow these guidelines:
