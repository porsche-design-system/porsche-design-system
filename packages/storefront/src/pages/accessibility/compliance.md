# Compliance

## Accessibility and the law
In most countries there are laws to protect the civil rights of persons with disabilities. 
Due to the fact that the internet provides global access to information, stores, education and financial institutions, these laws often include the support of web accessibility in web applications.

In some countries (especially in the US) website owners are admonished by lawyers with  

There are a lot of country specific standards and legislation which cannot be covered by only one ruleset mostly known as the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines [WCAG](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/) from the World WIde Web Consortium [W3C](https://www.w3.org/).

**[Overview of Web Accessibility Laws & Policies](https://www.w3.org/WAI/policies/)**

In the following a short overview over the most important countries/regions and how to be compliant with their laws.

### USA 

#### ADA (Americans with Disabilities Act)
The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) is a federal statute and thus any lawsuits filed under The ADA go straight to U.S. District Court.

### Europe

#### EU Web Accessibility Directive / European Accessibility Act

### Germany

#### Barrier-Free Information Technology (BITV 2.0)

### China

#### Law on the Protection of Persons with Disabilities

## How to deal with Accessibility and the law
The most effective way to maximize compliance is to start by observing worldwide regulations (W3C), as individual countries tend to base their regulations on global agreements. 
Therefore the [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/) are a good starting point which can be augmented by [Article 9 on Accessibility](https://www.un.org/development/desa/disabilities/convention-on-the-rights-of-persons-with-disabilities/article-9-accessibility.html) from the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD).

All these guidelines have one pitfall: they are very hard to read and difficult to interpret. We have developed basic guidelines which should help Designers and Developers to implement and support web accessibility in their applications.
