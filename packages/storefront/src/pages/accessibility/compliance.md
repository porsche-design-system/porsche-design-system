# Compliance

## Accessibility and the law
In most countries there are certain laws to protect the civil rights of persons with disabilities. 
Due to the fact that the internet provides global access to information, stores, education, financial institutions, etc., these laws often include the support of Web Accessibility in web applications.

In some countries (especially in the U.S.) website owners are **going to get sued** by lawyers which complain about the lack of (basic) accessibility support. 
There are a lot of [country specific standards](https://www.w3.org/WAI/policies/) and legislation which cannot be covered by only one ruleset mostly known as the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines [WCAG](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/) from the World Wide Web Consortium [W3C](https://www.w3.org/). 

But we can **reduce risk of legal entanglement** (receiving demand letter/getting sued), by following our **[accessibility guidelines and best practices](#/accessibility/guidelines)**.

## Regions/Countries and web accessibility standards

### USA 

#### Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA)
The [Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA)](https://www.ada.gov/) is a federal statute and thus any lawsuits filed under The ADA go straight to U.S. District Court. 

Recently the number of ADA Website Compliance lawsuits has been increased immensely because claims are easy for plaintiffs to make â€“ and they can be made from any state.

To make a Porsche web application accessibility conform with ADA's directives you have to follow the [WCAG 2.0 AA guidelines](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/) which can be seen as a basis of ADA.

### Europe

#### EU Web Accessibility Directive / European Accessibility Act
The [EU Web Accessibility Directive](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=uriserv:OJ.L_.2016.327.01.0001.01.ENG), in force since 22 December 2016, will provide people with disabilities better access to the websites and mobile apps of public services.

To make a Porsche web application accessibility conform with the EU's directives, you have to follow the latest harmonized standard of [Accessibility requirements for ICT products and services](https://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_en/301500_301599/301549/02.01.02_60/en_301549v020102p.pdf) which are also based on the [WCAG 2.1 AA guidelines](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/).

### Germany

#### Barrier-Free Information Technology (BITV 2.0)
The [Barrier-Free Information Technology](https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/bitv_2_0/index.html) law was updated in late 2019 and follows now mostly the [WCAG 2.1 guidelines](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/).

Although the BITV guidelines apply only for public institutions it is always recommended and a future save practice to make your own application **WCAG 2.1** compliant and therefore less vulnerable against legal entanglement.

### China

#### Law on the Protection of Persons with Disabilities
In China, the old standard [Law on the Protection of Persons with Disabilities](http://www.cdpf.org.cn/english/Resources/lawsregulations/201603/t20160303_542879.shtml) of 2008 will be replaced in March 2020 by the new standard [Information Technology Requirements and Testing Methods for Accessibility of Web Content](https://www.w3.org/blog/2020/02/updated-chinese-accessibility-standard/), which is also based on the **WCAG 2.0**.

## How to deal with accessibility and the law
To improve the support of accessibility in general, start by observing worldwide regulations (W3C), as individual countries tend to base their regulations on global agreements. 
Therefore the [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.0 AA](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/) are a good starting point which can be augmented by [Article 9 on Accessibility](https://www.un.org/development/desa/disabilities/convention-on-the-rights-of-persons-with-disabilities/article-9-accessibility.html) from the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD).

But as you might see, all these guidelines have one pitfall: they are very hard to read and difficult to interpret. Therefore we have developed a basic set of rules and guidelines which is the **most effective way to maximize compliance** and should help designers and developers to implement and support Web Accessibility in their applications.

**But always keep in mind:** Accessibility is not the fulfilment of a fixed ruleset or following a bunch of technical requirements. Instead, it's more about a mindset which should be a fixed part at the beginning of a project and face every possible aspect like strategy, conception, ux, ui, design, development, performance, etc.
