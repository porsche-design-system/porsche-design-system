# Workflow

## Introduction
As Porsche, we always want the best experience for everyone, regardless if the user **drives already a 911** or **wants to get information about a 911** and is therefore visiting our digital platforms.
To fulfill all kinds of experiences we have to build digital products which are usable and accessible. But how can we achieve a better experience for users with disabilities? Where do teams get started if they are not experienced in developing accessible products? 

As part of the Porsche UX Operations, we like the approach of helping people to help themselves. That's why we want to give **guidance how to build** digital products with accessibility in mind from scratch or enhance the accessibility on current projects which are already rolled out.

## The 5 principles for developing accessible digital products

    <p-headline variant="headline-3">What is web accessibility?</p-headline>
    <p-text>
      When websites and web tools are properly designed and coded, people with disabilities can use them. However, currently many sites and tools are developed with accessibility barriers that make them difficult or impossible for some people to use.
      Integrating accessibility into websites brings broader benefits to organizations, website visitors and society. For example, easier code maintenance and better user experiences, particularly on mobile devices. <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/">International web standards</a> define what is needed for accessibility.

      The better you and your colleagues understand accessibility, the more effectively it can be implemented and promoted in your team.
      Deepening your understanding of web accessibility helps you to address issues more effectively. Some sources for learning the basics include:
    </p-text>
    <p-text-list>
      <p-text-list-item>
        Research introductory articles and videos
      </p-text-list-item>
      <p-text-list-item>
        Find training appropriate for your particular role
      </p-text-list-item>
      <p-text-list-item>
        Seek information or training from accessibility and disability organizations
      </p-text-list-item>
      <p-text-list-item>
        Set up assistive technology demonstrations and let people try them out
      </p-text-list-item>
    </p-text-list>
    <p-text>
      First-hand experience of how people with disabilities access web content is often enlightening and inspiring.
      This can help you and others to understand the benefits and value of accessibility.

    <p-headline variant="headline-3">Integrate accessibility into your agile workflow</p-headline>
    <p-text>If you know the basics and the importance behind accessibility, start with <strong>setting up your team and environments</strong> to effectively implement accessibility improvements into your product.</p-text>
    <p-headline variant="headline-4">Team setup</p-headline>
    <p-text-list>
      <p-text-list-item>
        In your team, designate a <strong>person responsible</strong> for accessibility.
      </p-text-list-item>
      <p-text-list-item>
        Enable the team to <strong>improve their accessibility skills</strong> by giving time and space to learn.
      </p-text-list-item>
      <p-text-list-item>
        <strong>Accessibility is a mindset</strong> and should be observed by every discipline like UX, Development, Writing.

        Encourage the team to <strong>account for accessibility</strong> when creating and estimating stories.
      </p-text-list-item>
      <p-text-list-item>
        Add accessibility support of <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/">WCAG 2.1 AA</a> as an <strong>acceptance criteria</strong>, a <strong>non-functional requirement</strong> or into your <strong>definition of done</strong> to be a basic condition for each story or new feature.
      </p-text-list-item>
      <p-text-list-item>
        Add <strong>accessibility testing</strong> into each development sprint or QA check.
      </p-text-list-item>
      <p-text-list-item>
        When a new accessibility issue arises that you may have missed, <strong>prioritize those issues</strong> appropriately against other development concerns.
        Consider whether the error is critical, less critical, or minor:
        <p-text-list>
          <p-text-list-item>
            Critical issues will cause serious problems and/or stop most users of assistive technology from using the site.
          </p-text-list-item>
          <p-text-list-item>
            Less critical issues may cause problems or increased frustration for certain users.
          </p-text-list-item>
          <p-text-list-item>
            Minor issues will cause problems or frustration for a small number of users.

        </p-text-list>
      </p-text-list-item>
      <p-text-list-item>
        Consider prioritizing the issue if it appears on high-touch pages, critical user paths, or site-wide templates.

        All of the members of the development team should be enabled to <strong>install and use the right accessibility tools</strong> like Browser plugins, screen reader, contrast checker, etc.
      </p-text-list-item>
      <p-text-list-item>
        Work with your front end developers to choose an <strong>automated testing plan</strong>.

        Including automated accessibility testing throughout the development process can help quickly catch many accessibility errors, but can’t guarantee that your site is accessible. <strong>Always combine automated testing with ongoing manual testing</strong>.
