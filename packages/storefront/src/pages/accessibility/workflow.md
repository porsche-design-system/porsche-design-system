    <p-headline variant="headline-3">What is web accessibility?</p-headline>
    <p-text>
      When websites and web tools are properly designed and coded, people with disabilities can use them. However, currently many sites and tools are developed with <strong>accessibility barriers</strong> that make them difficult or impossible for some people to use.
      Integrating accessibility into websites brings broader benefits to organizations, website visitors and society. For example, easier code maintenance and better user experiences, particularly on mobile devices. <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/">International web standards</a> define what is needed for accessibility.
    </p-text>
    <p-text>
      The better you and your colleagues understand accessibility, the more effectively it can be implemented and promoted in your team.
      Deepening your understanding of web accessibility helps you to address issues more effectively. Some sources for learning the basics include:
    </p-text>
    <p-text-list>
      <p-text-list-item>
        Research introductory articles and videos
      </p-text-list-item>
      <p-text-list-item>
        Find training appropriate for your particular role
      </p-text-list-item>
      <p-text-list-item>
        Seek information or training from accessibility and disability organizations
      </p-text-list-item>
      <p-text-list-item>
        Set up assistive technology demonstrations and let people try them out
      </p-text-list-item>
    </p-text-list>
    <p-text>
      First-hand experience of how people with disabilities access web content is often enlightening and inspiring.
      This can help you and others to understand the benefits and value of accessibility.

    <p-headline variant="headline-3">Integrate accessibility into your agile workflow</p-headline>
    <p-text>If you know the basics and the importance of accessibility, start with <strong>setting up your team and environments</strong> to effectively implement accessibility improvements into your product.</p-text>
    <p-headline variant="headline-4">Team setup</p-headline>
    <p-text-list>
      <p-text-list-item>
        In your team, designate a <strong>person responsible</strong> for accessibility.
      </p-text-list-item>
      <p-text-list-item>
        Enable the team to <strong>improve their accessibility skills</strong> by giving them time and space to learn.
      </p-text-list-item>
      <p-text-list-item>
        <strong>Accessibility is a mindset</strong> and should be observed by every discipline like UX, Development, Writing.
      </p-text-list-item>
    </p-text-list>
    <p-headline variant="headline-4">Workflow setup</p-headline>
    <p-text-list>
      <p-text-list-item>
        Encourage the team to <strong>account for accessibility</strong> in the earliest phases when creating and estimating stories.
      </p-text-list-item>
      <p-text-list-item>
        Add accessibility support of <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/">WCAG 2.1 AA</a> as an<strong>acceptance criterion</strong>, a <strong>non-functional requirement</strong> or into your <strong>definition of done</strong> to be a basic condition for each story or new feature.
      </p-text-list-item>
      <p-text-list-item>
        Add <strong>accessibility testing</strong> into each development sprint or QA check.
      </p-text-list-item>
      <p-text-list-item>
        When a new accessibility issue arises that you may have missed, <strong>prioritize those issues</strong> appropriately against other development concerns.
        Consider whether the error is critical, less critical, or minor:
        <p-text-list>
          <p-text-list-item>
            Critical issues will cause serious problems and/or stop most users of assistive technology from using the site.
          </p-text-list-item>
          <p-text-list-item>
            Less critical issues may cause problems or increased frustration for certain users.
          </p-text-list-item>
          <p-text-list-item>
            Minor issues will cause problems or frustration for a small number of users.
          </p-text-list-item>
        </p-text-list>
      </p-text-list-item>
      <p-text-list-item>
        Consider prioritizing the issue if it appears on high-touch pages, critical user paths, or site-wide templates.

    <p-text-list>
      <p-text-list-item>
        All of the members of the development team should be enabled to <strong>install and use the right accessibility tools</strong> like browser plugins, screen reader, contrast checker, etc.
      </p-text-list-item>
      <p-text-list-item>
        Work with your front end developers to choose an <strong>automated testing plan</strong>.
      </p-text-list-item>
      <p-text-list-item>
        Including automated accessibility testing throughout the development process can help quickly catch many accessibility errors, but can’t guarantee that your site is accessible. <strong>Always combine automated testing with ongoing manual testing</strong>.

  <p-tabs-item label="3. Build">
    <p-headline variant="headline-3">Building Accessible Software</p-headline>
    <p-text>Building accessible software might be hard, especially if the user interface is complex comes with many interactions. Therefore it is substantial that every discipline is working together and sharing their findings with the whole team.</p-text>
    <p-headline variant="headline-5" tag="h4">Level of Web Accessibility we need to support</p-headline>
    <p-text>As a <strong>global acting company</strong> Porsche has to fulfill certain accessibility criteria which can be different from country to country. To grant a well balanced and global level of accessibility, we recommend making all web applications compliant with the <strong>Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.1</strong> <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/">WCAG-2.1</a> at <strong>level AA</strong>.</p-text>
    <p-text>Do not expect that accessibility is a one time effort, it is more an iterative process of constantly learning, building, testing and hopefully improving accessibility in your product. Building accessible software has to be seen as a whole concept which concerns many disciplines:</p-text>

    <p-text>
      In most cases, a software application is orchestrated out of many individual components, modules, microservices and even 3rd party software. Though each of them should be tested and verified during development, we have to make sure, that they all fit into the application and are <strong>accessibility compliant</strong> as a whole.
      This is where an Accessibility Audit comes into play.
    </p-text>
    <p-headline variant="headline-3">Prerequisites</p-headline>
    <p-text>To perform an Accessibility Audit you should define what and how to test.</p-text>
    <p-text-list>
      <p-text-list-item>
        Define a whole user journey or dedicated pages/modules to be tested.
      </p-text-list-item>
      <p-text-list-item>
        Make sure your application is reachable for the testers.

      </p-text-list-item>
      <p-text-list-item>
        Before performing an audit, make sure that the development team has done the best to enhance accessibility.

    <p-headline variant="headline-3">Accessibility is never done</p-headline>
    <p-text>Though your team has weighed in a lot of effort regarding accessibility and your application seems to be fully accessible compliant, your work is not done yet. With every change, with every new feature, with every update comes the responsibility that accessibility remains a priority and issues are identified and solved.</p-text>
    <p-headline variant="headline-4">Monitor</p-headline>
    <p-text>Integrating an <strong>automated accessibility test</strong> into your build pipeline is a good starting point to keep track of possible issues when the application is updated. But automated testing covers only up to 20% of possible issues. Therefore it is a good choice to have audits and <strong>manual tests</strong> regulary.</p-text>
    <p-text>Monitoring your application is mandatory and should be part of your production workflow. Monitoring shouldn't be limited to finding issues but <strong>measuring your progress</strong> should be part as well.</p-text>
    <p-text>Some of possible measurable criteria could be:</p-text>
    <p-text-list>
      <p-text-list-item>
        The number of WCAG Success Criteria passed, and their level.
      </p-text-list-item>
      <p-text-list-item>
        Number of complaints received related to accessibility.
      </p-text-list-item>
      <p-text-list-item>
        Calls were handley by people who were unable to process their application online.
      </p-text-list-item>
      <p-text-list-item>
        Positive social media comments on the accessibility of service.
      </p-text-list-item>
    </p-text-list>
    <p-headline variant="headline-4">Prioritize</p-headline>
    <p-text>If accessibility issues are detected, it is common to prioritize them regarding their estimated effort and they might be prioritized down so that other development goals could be achieved. This shouldn't happen but as we all know this can happen e.g. due to tight timelines.</p-text>
    <p-text>To prevent this situation of always prioritizing down, make sure to split accessibility issues into smaller stories and plan at least a fixed number in every sprint. Always keep in mind, that the later accessibility is observed the more effort it will take to implement. </p-text>
    <p-headline variant="headline-4">Track standards and laws</p-headline>
    <p-text>Though it might give the impression that the official standards of <strong>WCAG 2.1</strong> don't have changed since a decade, the W3C is working on the following standard of <strong>WCAG 3.0</strong> which currently is in a first public working draft. So it's a good choice to keep up with the latest progressions and be prepared if they are released.</p-text>
    <p-text>But not only the official standards may change, even more important is to keep an eye on <strong>worldwide laws and policies</strong> and how they are handled by regions and countries. Here are some of the latest changes in important markets:</p-text>
    <p-text-list>
      <p-text-list-item>
        In Canada, the Accessibility for Ontarians with Disabilities Act dictates that private or non-profit organizations with more than 50 employees have to <strong>accessibility compliant</strong> with WCAG 2.0 AA <strong>from January 2021</strong>.
      </p-text-list-item>
      <p-text-list-item>
        In the U.S. they are working on a new <strong>Online Accessibility Act</strong> which will extend the current <strong>Americans with Disabilities Act</strong> to cover <strong>consumer-facing websites</strong> and mobile applications that are owned or operated by a private entity.
      </p-text-list-item>
      <p-text-list-item>
        Europe adopted the <strong>Europeans with Disabilities Act</strong> in 2019 which also includes the accessibility conformance of <strong>e-commerce</strong> and mobile applications.
      </p-text-list-item>
    </p-text-list>
    <p-headline variant="headline-4">Adapt to new technologies</p-headline>
    <p-text>Not only Browsers do evolve, but also <strong>assistive technologies</strong>. Include devices like screen readers into your support list and enhance your tests also to mobile devices which come with huge improvements and tools for people with disabilities to better access your applications.</p-text>
    <p-headline variant="headline-4">Hear your users</p-headline>
    <p-text>User feedback is one of the most valuable things you can get. By adding an <strong>Accessibility Statement</strong> on your application, you give users a good overview of the current state of accessibility and give the possibility for direct feedback as well.</p-text>
    <p-headline variant="headline-4">Share your knowledge</p-headline>
    <p-text>As we all know, building accessible products is not easy. The more we have to pull together and exchange our knowledge and experiences. As a starting point, take part in our (upcoming) <strong>Accessibility-Guild</strong> on Slack.</p-text>
    <p-text>But not only sharing experiences is helpful for others, but also showing your successes. <strong>Be proud of building better products for everyone!</strong></p-text>
