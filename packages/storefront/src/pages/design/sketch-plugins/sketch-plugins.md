Sketch offers the possibility to increase its functionality - and, due to that, the design efficiency and joy of use - with a variety of plugins. Within the Porsche UI Kit, we strive to minimize the number of external resources we depend on. Nevertheless, it cannot be denied that there are a few sketch plugins that push the design efficiency to another level - therefore, we consider (very!) few of them as 'must haves' and others only as ’nice to use'.  
  
## Must-have plugins  
  
👉🏻 **Plugins that are highly recommended to use, as some components are optimized on their functionality.**  
  
### Anima ToolKit  
[Anima ToolKit - Sketch to HTML](https://www.animaapp.com)  
Anima offers a variety of pretty cool and helpful layouting options, such as Padding Groups (making e.g. the buttons adjust automagically to the text length) or Stacked Groups (fixed alignment and spacing for grouped elements).
Please make sure to have the following option activated to get the most out of it: Plugins → Anima Toolkit → Enable Paddings and Stacks for nested symbols.

## Nice-to-use plugins
