# Introduction

## Porsche Design System - Assets

Porsche Design System stores some files like icons, fonts, marque, etc. as versioned static assets on CDN for fast delivery and improved caching. 
Most of these assets are used within our components (e.g. `<p-marque>`) but can also be used as standalone assets in projects which either do not use the Porsche Design System or we can't deliver a corresponding component for the asset (e.g. favicons).

To give teams the possibility to get the versioned file paths to these static assets we provide an asset package which contains manifest files for easy reference to our global asset files.

**Actually we provide assets for:**
- [Icons](#/assets/icons)
- [Metaicons like favicon and touch icons](#/assets/metaicons)
- [Marque](#/assets/marque)
- [Porsche Next Webfonts](#/assets/fonts)
