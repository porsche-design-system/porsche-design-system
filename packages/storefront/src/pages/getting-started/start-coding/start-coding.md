# Start Coding

Porsche UI Kit provides a collection of pre-built (React) presentational components to developers for building clean and qualitative front-ends that innately come with the latest design definitions. Applications that use another frontend framework or none can include the (S)CSS styles and use the compiled HTML.

All releases of the Porsche UI Kit are available as versioned npm package called `@porscheui/ui-kit` at private npm registry ([https://porscheui.jfrog.io](https://porscheui.jfrog.io)). To use specific contents you have to integrate the NPM package as dependency in your application.

## Getting started
Please [request for a Porsche UI npm registry account](http://eepurl.com/gnOIXD).  

The release of the first stable version `v1` of Porsche UI Kit is planned by the end of Q2/2019. Beta-releases might be available earlier. The new version will contain refactored, optimized and tested *React components* as well as pure *HTML/CSS patterns*.
**We'll update this installation guide as soon as `v1` is finally released.**
