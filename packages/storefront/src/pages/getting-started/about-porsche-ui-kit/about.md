# About the Porsche UI Kit
The Porsche UI Kit unites digital Porsche products around a shared design system, enabling everyone to speak the same language, work with the same tools and use prebuilt resources. To efficiently create outstanding digital products: consistently, brand-appropriately and in high quality.

## Benefits for business, design and development

**Ship faster and focus on value.**  
Stop wasting time on repetitive work and recreating things that already exist. Use the components and working methods to enable faster releases and quick iterations. And focus on valuable results and solving important problems.

**Improve the user experience.**  
Reusing the pre-built design elements ensures a consistent look and feel across different products, platforms and disciplines. Design patterns along the products that match the marketing and improve familarity, brand awareness and overall experience.

**Maintain quality in the long term.**  
Our centrally built and continuously maintained design system with standardised components and unified toolings pays off with high-quality results. Everything innately meeting the latest technical requirements and standards for accessibility, performance and usability.

**Leverage knowledge and clarity.**  
With everyone having access to the system and using the same language, it is much easier to collaborate and share knowledge with a clear understanding. Onboardings for new members are much easier and faster.

## Principles of success for the Porsche UI Kit
The Porsche UI Kit encourages trust rather than policing by empowering self-responsible teamwork. To take full advantage of the benefits, we apply the following principles:

* **Use the contents as a foundation** without modification upon which to build individual designs
* **Collaborate** between design and development, just as we do
* **Update continuously** to avoid increasing update deficits
* **Join the community** through our channels and rituals
* **Participate in our evolution** by contributing and giving feedback
