# About the Porsche UI Kit
The Porsche UI Kit unites digital design at Porscha around a shared design system - including standardised tools, processes and resources for designing outstanding digital products. Therefore the Porsche UI Kit provides a prebuilt collection of reusable styles and components with corresponding documentation. It consists of a basic design library and an extended library for web components.

## Benefits for Business, Design and Development

Everything innately with highest quality in accessibility, compatibility and performance. By centrally creating and maintaining the essential design elements, the consuming teams can increase their implementation speed and focus the efforts on building aesthetic and valuable products.
