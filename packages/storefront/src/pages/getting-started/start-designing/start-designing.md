# Start Designing

The Porsche UI Kit enables designers to create outstanding digital designs by using the prebuild libraries, styles and layout templates - fast and qualitative. To improve the output efficiency and reduce maintenance cost we decided on using the tools Sketch and Abstract ([Read more about Abstract](https://www.goabstract.com/how-it-works/)).

## Getting started
1. Please first [request a Porsche UI Abstract Seat](http://eepurl.com/gnOIXD) to access and work within the Porsche UI organisation. 
2. Install the most recent version of [Sketch](https://www.sketch.com/updates/) including the [Anima Plugin](https://www.animaapp.com/) 
3. Install the latest [Abstract Desktop App](https://app.goabstract.com/)

## Include the Sketch Libraries

The Porsche UI Kit is split into a two libraries that are required to be linked.  
A basic library for the overall fundamental layer and text styles and colors. And a web library, which includes the web applications related resources and component symbols.

[Link Porsche UI Kit Basic](sketch://add-library?url=https%3A%2F%2Fui.porsche.com%2Fporsche-ui-kit-basic.sketch.xml)  
[Link Porsche UI Kit Web](sketch://add-library?url=https%3A%2F%2Fui.porsche.com%2Fporsche-ui-kit-web.sketch.xml)

You will find the linked library and its version number in Preferences â†’ Libraries. For the future Sketch will automatically check for updates of the Library. Please be aware of the versioning and align with your developer counterpart on the used version.
