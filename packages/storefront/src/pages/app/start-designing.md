## Start Designing

The Porsche Design System enables designers to create outstanding digital designs by using the prebuild libraries, styles and templates - fast and qualitative. 

## 1. Before the first design
To improve output efficiency and reduce maintenance costs, we decided to set the tools [Sketch](https://www.sketch.com/) and [Abstract](https://www.goabstract.com/) as standard at Porsche. 

Please first [request a Porsche Abstract Seat](http://eepurl.com/gnOIXD) to access and work within the Porsche organisation and install the latest [Abstract Desktop App](https://app.goabstract.com/). 

You can find a [detailed guideline how to use Absctract here](#/web/getting-started/design-workflow).

## 2. Getting started
To get a smooth and easy onboaring experience, you are welcome either to have a look into other digital Porsche projects within our [Porsche Abstract Organisation](https://app.abstract.com/organizations/bc37bb03-3469-4b15-99a2-60dbec187bce/projects). 

Or you use our pre-built Sketch Layout Templates, that contain artboards in all relevant screen sizes enriched by the right layout and grid presets. (Can be turned visible via: View → Canvas → Show Layout).

## 3. Using the Sketch Library
The components of the Porsche Design System are provided in two Sketch libraries that can be easily linked with Sketch by clicking on the following RSS library links. Once linked, Sketch will automatically check for updates. 

### Install Anima Plugin
Some of the components offer smooth layout behaviour such as automatic resizing and positioning. To use it you have to install the Sketch plugin [Anima](https://www.animaapp.com/). (Ensure to turn on the setting: Plugins → Anima Toolkit → Enable Padding and Stacks for Nested Symbols).   

### Basic Library and Porsche Typeface
The basic library contains the design fundamentals, such as typography, colors and icons.  
[Download Porsche Design System Basic](sketch://add-library?url=https%3A%2F%2Fdesignsystem.porsche.com%2Fporsche-design-system-basic.sketch.xml) 

To use the library properly you have to download and install the [Porsche Next font here](https://cdn.ui.porsche.com/porsche-design-system/font/v1/Porsche_Next_WebOTF_Lat-Gr-Cyr.zip). 

### Web Library
The web library provides components that are to be used within web applications, like buttons, form elements and many more.  
[Download Porsche Design System Web](sketch://add-library?url=https%3A%2F%2Fdesignsystem.porsche.com%2Fporsche-design-system-web.sketch.xml)

Please be aware of the used library version (Sketch: Preferences → Libraries) and coordinate with your developer counterpart to align on the same version.

## Sketch palette
Enrich your Porsche design experience by using the Porsche color palette in your Sketch color picker. The easiest way to import the palette to Sketch is by using the plugin [Sketch Palettes](https://github.com/andrewfiorillo/sketch-palettes).
