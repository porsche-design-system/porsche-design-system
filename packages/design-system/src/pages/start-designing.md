# Start Designing

The Porsche UI Kit enables designers to create outstanding digital designs by using the prebuild libraries, styles and templates - fast and qualitative. 

## Sketch Library
The components of the Porsche UI Kit are provided in two Sketch libraries that can be easily linked with Sketch by clicking on the following RSS library links. Once linked, Sketch will automatically check for updates. 
Please note the library version being used (Sketch: Preferences → Libraries) and coordinate with your developer counterpart to use the same version.

### Basic Library
The basic library contains the fundamental elements that can be used both individually and within the components, such as typography, colours or spacings.  
[Download Porsche UI Kit Basic](sketch://add-library?url=https%3A%2F%2Fui.porsche.com%2Fporsche-ui-kit-basic.sketch.xml)  

### Web Library
The web library provides components that are to be used within web applications, like buttons, form elements and many more.

### App library
The App Library is containing specific components for native apps.

## Sketch layout template
To get a smooth and easy "designing from scratch" experience, you are welcome to use the following Sketch layout template. It contains artboards in all relevant screen sizes and is enriched with the right layout and grid presets (that can be turned visible via: View → Canvas → Show Layout).

## Sketch color palette
Enrich your Porsche UI design experience by using the Porsche color palette in your Sketch color picker. The easiest way to import the palette to Sketch is by using the plugin [Sketch Palettes](https://github.com/andrewfiorillo/sketch-palettes).

## Sketch Plugins
Some of the components offer smooth layout behaviour (such as automatic resizing on content input). To get the most out of it, please install the Sketch plugin [Anima](https://www.animaapp.com/).  
A curated list of more plugins that are recommended (but not obligatory) for a smooth Sketch workflow can be found [here](#/getting-started/sketch-plugins).

## Typeface
You can download the [Porsche Next font here](http://cdn.ui.porsche.com/porsche-ui-kit/font/v1/Porsche_Next_Desktop_OTF_Lat-Gr-Cyr.zip). 

## Design Workflow
To improve output efficiency and reduce maintenance costs, we decided to use the tools [Sketch](https://www.sketch.com/) and [Abstract](https://www.goabstract.com/how-it-works/). 

Before starting to design with the Sketch library, make sure to [request a Porsche UI Abstract Seat](http://eepurl.com/gnOIXD) to access and work within the Porsche UI organisation, and to install the latest [Abstract Desktop App](https://app.goabstract.com/)
