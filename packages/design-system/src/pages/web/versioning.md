# Versioning

## General information
For updating and releasing new versions of code or design changes, the [SemanticVersioning](http://semver.org/) format is used:  

MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH e.g. 1.0.1
* **Major** (X.y.z) contain breaking changes (defined below).
* **Minor** (x.Y.z) add new features or deprecate existing features without breaking changes.
* **Patch** (x.y.Z) fix defects or optimise existing features and file structure without breaking changes.

Teams should avoid mixing different versions of code and design library. Both parties should drive updating in collaboration with the related counterpart.

## Release rules
* **Once a versioned package has been released, the contents of that version must not be modified. Any modifications must be released as a new version.** 
* **We align design and code versioning in major and minor**
* **Version changes are part of every pull request following the SamVer rules**
* **We only allow one breaking change per major release.**
* **Every version change must be documented clearly in the change log.** 
* **In design, the version must be contained in the library file name.**

## Versioning examples
Some examples for SemVer within the Porsche UI Kit:

### MAJOR version when
* Change to style that triggers a layout change or different wrapping behaviour
* Markup change that must be included or is being updated
* Change to code constants
* Context-relevant changes in style basics, i.e. primary colour or icon assets with same meaning
* Changes that can affect layout outside of content, i.e. display properties
* Upgrade to dependencies
* Deletion or moving of shared mixins or placeholders
* Changing of hard-coded asset paths, i.e. background src
* Removal of an accessibility-relevant attribute or property, relevant for assistive functionality.

### MINOR version when
* Addition of something new or a new variation of existing content, i.e. new error states
* Addition of attributes to markup that donâ€™t affect the rendering of the markup, i.e. new aria attributes
* Updating of values of constants that do not result in a breaking change
* Deprecation of existing contents without deletion

### PATCH version when
* Update to package dependencies
* Structural changes not affecting refs
* Fixing of defects and optimisation of existing code, e.g. a markup value or modification to constant keys
* Changes to plugins or application-related improvements

### NO RELEASE when
* Update to dev dependencies
* Addition of tests or examples
* Update to examples and documentation
