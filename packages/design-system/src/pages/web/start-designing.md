# Start Designing

The Porsche UI Kit enables designers to create outstanding digital designs by using the prebuilt libraries, styles and templates - fast and with high quality. 

## 1. Tooling
To improve output efficiency and reduce maintenance costs, we decided to set the tools [Sketch](https://www.sketch.com/) and [Abstract](https://www.goabstract.com/) as standard at Porsche. 

Please first [request a Porsche UI Abstract seat](http://eepurl.com/gnOIXD) to access and work within the Porsche UI organisation. Then install the latest [Abstract desktop app](https://app.goabstract.com/). 

You can find a [detailed guideline how to use Abstract here](#/web/getting-started/design-workflow).

## 2. Get inspired 
After you received your Abstract invitation you can get a smooth and easy onboaring experience. You are welcome to have a look into other digital Porsche projects within our [Porsche Abstract Organisation](https://app.abstract.com/organizations/bc37bb03-3469-4b15-99a2-60dbec187bce/projects) and use them as starting point.

## 3. Layout setup
No need to design from scratch anymore! Instead, you can use our prebuilt Sketch layout templates. They contain artboards in all relevant responsive screen sizes enriched by the right layout and grid presets (which can be turned visible via: View → Canvas → Show Layout).

## 4. Sketch libraries
The components of the Porsche UI Kit are provided in two Sketch libraries that can be easily linked with Sketch by clicking on the following RSS library links. Once linked, Sketch will automatically check for updates. 

### Basic Library 
The basic library contains the design fundamentals, such as typography, colours and icons.  
[Download Porsche UI Kit Basic](sketch://add-library?url=https%3A%2F%2Fui.porsche.com%2Fporsche-ui-kit-basic.sketch.xml) 

### Web Library
The web library provides components that are to be used within web applications, like buttons, form elements and many more.  
[Download Porsche UI Kit Web](sketch://add-library?url=https%3A%2F%2Fui.porsche.com%2Fporsche-ui-kit-web.sketch.xml)

Please be aware of the used library version (Sketch: Preferences → Libraries) and coordinate with your developer counterpart to align on the same version.

### Recommended add-ons

Make sure to install the following assets to get the best out of the Porsche UI Kit libraries:

**Anima Plugin**
Some of the components offer smooth layout behaviour such as automatic resizing and positioning. Enjoy it by installing the Sketch plugin [Anima](https://www.animaapp.com/). (Ensure to turn on the setting: Plugins → Anima Toolkit → Enable Padding and Stacks for Nested Symbols.   

**Porsche Next font**
In order to design Porsche web applications and to use the Porsche UI Kit libraries properly you have to download and install the [Porsche Next font](http://cdn.ui.porsche.com/porsche-ui-kit/font/v1/Porsche_Next_Desktop_OTF_Lat-Gr-Cyr.zip). 


## 5. Additional tools

## Sketch color palette
Enrich your Porsche UI design experience by using the Porsche color palette in your Sketch color picker. The easiest way to import the palette to Sketch is by using the plugin [Sketch Palettes](https://github.com/andrewfiorillo/sketch-palettes).
