# Start Coding

Porsche UI Kit provides developers with a collection of pre-built web components for building clean and high-quality front-ends that innately come with the latest design definitions. It also contains predefined [SCSS functions, mixins and variables](#/scss-utils/introduction) to build individual components upon.

All releases of the Porsche UI Kit are available as a versioned npm package `@porscheui/ui-kit` in the private npm registry ([https://porscheui.jfrog.io](https://porscheui.jfrog.io)). To use specific contents, you have to integrate the NPM package as a dependency in your application.

## Getting started
Please [request a Porsche UI npm registry account](http://eepurl.com/gnOIXD).  

The release of the first stable version `v1` of the Porsche UI Kit is planned by the end of Q2/2019. Beta releases might be available earlier.
**We'll update this installation guide as soon as `v1` is finally released.**
