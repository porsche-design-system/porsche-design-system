# Start Coding

Porsche UI Kit provides developers with a collection of pre-built (React) presentational components for building clean and high-quality front-ends that innately come with the latest design definitions. Applications that use another frontend framework or none can include the (S)CSS styles and use the compiled HTML.

All releases of the Porsche UI Kit are available as a versioned npm package called `@porscheui/ui-kit` in the private npm registry ([https://porscheui.jfrog.io](https://porscheui.jfrog.io)). To use specific contents, you have to integrate the NPM package as a dependency in your application.

## Getting started
Please [request a Porsche UI npm registry account](http://eepurl.com/gnOIXD).  

The release of the first stable version `v1` of the Porsche UI Kit is planned by the end of Q2/2019. Beta releases might be available earlier. The new version will contain refactored, optimised and tested *React components* as well as pure *HTML/CSS patterns*.
**We'll update this installation guide as soon as `v1` is finally released.**
