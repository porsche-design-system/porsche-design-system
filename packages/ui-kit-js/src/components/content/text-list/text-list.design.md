# Text List

A text list groups and organizes related content vertically in two hierarchical levels (level 1 and level 2 with indent). Generally, lists are supposed to be used for short pieces of information and should not exceed two levels hierarchy . For more complex data sets, consider the use of a data table.

## Available variants

The Test List comes in 2 different variants:

- **Unordered List** to show content with equal value.

## Order
Arrange list items in a logical way, from  highest to lowest level. Split the content up into smaller and more specific categories and group them. 

## Writing style
It is recommended to stick to a homogeneous writing structure and style within one list. Avoid e.g. mixing active with passive voice or declarative with imperative sentences. 

## Capitalization
Use sentence-style capitalization for each list item: capitalize only the first letter of the item.
