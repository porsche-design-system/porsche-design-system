# Typography

Typography plays an important role for the general brand impression and is indispensable for the use in digital applications -
not to say: Typography **is** the interface – just imagine the porsche.com without any text. 
Typography enables to create a meaningful information hierarchy as well as structure and is therefore one of the most important elements
to provide user guidance.

## Typeface: Porsche Next

The special Porsche feeling is decisively shaped by the use of the corporate typeface Porsche Next that has been exclusively designed
for Porsche. Therefore, it is the only typeface allowed to be used for Porsche in both print and digital media.
Being part of a high-class layout the typeface communicates the brand values of modernism, clarity and functionality
and, speaking of digital usage, supports both content structure and a good readability.

### Download

You can download the Porsche Next from the [Porsche Brand Guide](https://brandguide.porsche.com/elements/manual/view/id/885). 
Make sure to use the OTF format for designing in Sketch, as it is also used within the Porsche UI Kit components.

### Look and feel

The shape of Porsche Next follows the typical Porsche lines and unites the exclusive, high-classy, yet very sportive brand image, resulting in a high recognisability.
Formally, the impression of the Porsche Next is largely determined by the visual character of the "squircle", a combination of square and circle
which is reflected in the curves and circular shapes of the typeface.

### Language versions

The Porsche Next contains all the typeface characters required for European, Greek and Cyrillic languages in a single file, 
all of which are available in the same font weights.

#### Arabic
For languages such as Arabic, Pashtu, Persian and Urdu, a second typeface pack is available.

#### Chinese / Japanese
For Chinese and Japanese language, the following system fonts are to be used, sticking to the default Porsche font scaling system:

- Chinese: 黑体,SimHei,宋体,SimSun,sans-serif
- Japanese: MS PGothic,sans-serif

## Porsche type scale

The Porsche type scale is a dedicated sizing system based on a specific formula.

12 16 20 24 28 30 32 36 42 44 48 52 60 62 72 84 

❌ @DEV: DIE JEWEILIGE ZAHL BITTE IN DER ENTSPRECHENDEN GRÖSSE DARSTELLEN, VORZUGSWEISE ALLES IN EINER ZEILE.❌
❌ TBD: ABBILDUNG TYPE SCALE FORMEL? ❌

### Type scale calculator

The vast majority of font sizes required for your UI designs should be covered with the provided font size classes.
Nevertheless there might be specific cases in which you need additional sizes larger than 84 px (smaller sizes than 12 px 
should be avoided for legibility reasons).

❌ @DEV: KÖNNEN WIR AN DER STELLE EINEN ENTSPRECHENDEN CALCULATOR EINBAUEN? ❌
❌ FALLS NEIN, WÜRDE ICH DEN PART VORERST KOMPLETT RAUSLASSEN, DA SONST ZU KOMPLIZIERT. EXTRA GRÖSSEN SOLLTEN OHNEHIN NUR EDGE CASES SEIN. ❌

### Line height

For reasons of legibility, the line height should always be adjusted to the respective text size.
It is recommended that the line height should be [at least 150% of the text size in use](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20-TECHS/C21.html).
The text styles provided do not only follow this recommendation, but also work with a 4 px baseline unit that fits to the [8 px spacing system](#/layout/spacing) 
in order to follow a harmonious overall vertical rhythm.

## Text styles

The Porsche typography system provides various text styles that follow the Porsche type scale.
Being provided both as text styles in the Porsche UI Kit Sketch library and as code components makes it easy for you to 
apply these styles within your digital designs.


### Headline styles

The Porsche headline styles should only be used for first-level headlines whose function is to lead a page, section or content area.
For Porsche headlines styles only bold weight is used to provide a good readability and making it easy as possible to focus on the content sections of a page.
Likewise, Bold perfectly embodies the brand's claim to modernism, power and strength.
The headline styles span from Large Title, that can be used optionally and only once per page, to Headlines 1 to 4 that can be used multiple times.

|                  | 320 - 759 px (XS)     | 760 - 999 px (S)   | 1000 - 1299 px (M)   | 1300 - 1759 px (L)   | 1760  px or larger (XL)   |
|------------------|---------------------  |------------------	|-------------------   |-------------------   |------------------------   |
| Large Title      | 32 px (2 rem)         | 42 px (2,625 rem)  | 52 px (3,25 rem)     | 62 px (3,875 rem)    | 72 px (4,5 rem)           | 
| Headline-1       | 28 px (1,75 rem)      | 36 px (2,25 rem)   | 44 px (2,75 rem)     | 52 px (3,25 rem)     | 60 px (3,75 rem)          | 
| Headline-2       | 24 px (1,5 rem)       | 30 px (1,875 rem)  | 36 px (2,25rem)      | 42 px (2,625 rem)    | 48 px (3 rem)             | 
| Headline-3       | 20 px (1,25 rem)      | 24 px (1,5 rem)    | 28 px (1,75 rem)     | 32 px (2 rem)        | 36 px (2,25 rem)          | 
| Headline-4       | 16 px (1 rem)         | 18 px (1,125 rem)  | 20 px (1,25 rem)     | 22 px (1,375 rem)    | 24 px (1,5 rem)           | 

❌ BILD: BEISPIEL HEADLINE ❌

#### Applying headline styles

Depending on your layout, you don't necessarily have to start with Headline 1. Also, it is possible to skip headline sizes whenever it serves the information structure.
It is much more important to keep an eye on a homogeneous use of text sizes within one application.
Also, please note that the headline class namings don't necessarily refer to the HTML font tags. For example the style Headline-1 can also technically be implemented as `<h2>`.

#### Headline-subline-combinations

A first-level headline can be supplemented by a corresponding subline. Make sure to stick to the following rules when using sublines:

- Sublines must be set in Regular, using a "Additional sizes" class.
- The subline size must be at least two sizing steps smaller than the corresponding headline.

### Copytext styles

The Porsche copytext styles are typically to be used for long-form writing. Per default, you should stick to the **Copytext** class.
**Copytext Small** is only recommended for additional, low-informative text such as disclaimers or captions.
Both Copytext and Copytext Small keep their respective text size throughout all viewports.

|                 | FONT SIZE       | AVAILABLE STATES                             | 
|---------------- |---------------- |--------------------------------------------- |
| Copytext        | 16 px           | active, default, disabled, highlight, linked | 
| Copytext Small  | 12 px           | active, default, disabled, highlight, linked | 


❌ BILD: STATES IN LIGHT & DARK THEME ❌ 

### Additional sizes 

Whenever you have the need to display larger text that isn't explicitly a page or section headline – let's say, for example, large numbers in vehicle data or quotes –
you can stick to the additional sizes provided in the Porsche UI Kit, starting from 20 px and following the Porsche type scale.
Depending on the information level of the respective text you can either chose between Regular or Thin text.

## Font styling

### Text color

The color to be used for Porsche Next depends on the [Porsche Color Theme](#/basic/color) in use.
In order to support both simplicity and and legibility (sufficient contrast) default text is either to be set in Porsche Black or Porsche Light.
For copytext sizes the Porsche Color Themes also provide different text state colors, such as Porsche Red for active states or Grey for disabled text.

### Font weights

The Porsche Next is available in different font weights that enable to add emphasis and create a visual content hierarchy.
For digital applications, we recommend only to use Bold, Regular and Thin:

- **Porsche Next Bold** for first-level headlines or copytext highlights.
- **Porsche Next Regular** for copytext, stand-alone text or sublines (in combination with first-level headlines).
- **Porsche Next Thin** for stand-alone text larger than 20 px.

![Porsche Next Squircles](assets/workshop/basic/typography/assets/typography-font-weights.png)


### Text alignment

Per default, the Porsche Next is always used left-aligned. In individual cases or certain components it can also be used centered,
but keep in mind not to exeed 3 text lines, as it is much harder to read. Also, right-aligned text is possible in exceptional
cases, for example in tables where right-aligned numbers support readability.

Please avoid…

- … using the font in block typesetting, as this does not correspond with the high-quality brand image.
- … mixing up different text alignments within one paragraph. Keep it straight and simple.

### Line length

The longer a text line gets, the harder it is for the user to jump from the end of the current line to the beginning of the next line.
Therefore we should always aim at a line length that supports good readability.

For UI applications it is recommended to use [no more than 80 characters or glyphs per line](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/visual-audio-contrast-visual-presentation.html).
This might differ a bit depending on the respective line height and viewport size and results in different pixel widths depending on the Porsche type class in use:

- Copytext Small (12 px): max. 400-450 px
- Copytext (16 px): max. 500-550 px
- Headlines and additional sizes (20-84 px): max. 700 up to max. 2700 px


### Multi-column text

Text paragraphs should always preferably be set as single column. Multi-column text should never acceed 3 columns and is only allowed when it can be
ensured that all text columns are in the visible viewport range ("above the fold"). The user should not have to scroll before being able
to read the full content.

### Paragraph spacing

### Modifications

Please avoid to transform the Porsche Next manually (e.g. within Sketch or via CSS), as this would have a big and undesirable
impact on the origin character of the company typeface. This includes:

- No change of letter-spacing.
- No use of (drop) shadows on text.
- No formal change of letters (for example distortion).
- No use of outline borders on text.
- No use of small capitals.
- No use of opacity for text colors.

## Typography principles

For Porsche web applications, good typography is…

### … functional.
Use typography to provide clear hierarchy, to organize content and to guide the user through the digital product journey.

### … clear.
Use typography to provide both efficiency and, from a more visual point of view, to support the clear and modern 
look and feel of a Porsche application.

### … readable.
Never use typography by the sake of itself or as "eye candy". It should always support the usability of 
a website by making text readable due to a good text color contrast and sufficient text sizes.

### … purposeful.
Use typography wisely and always keep an eye on the user's needs and the purpose of the content you want to communicate.

### … a matter of course.
Always use typography in a professional manner in order to support the exclusiveness and high-quality-standard of the brand.
This not only means to make use of the pre-defined type styles provided in the Porsche UI Kit, but also to follow the general rules
of good (micro) typography, such as using the right kind of apostrophes in the respective language.
