## **Content**

The Link Pure component includes the following sub-components:

- **Icon** The icon within the Link Pure component can be replaced by any icon available in the Porsche web icon set. Per default, an arrow right is set that should serve in most of all cases.

- **Text label** The text label within the Link Pure component should be short and descriptive.

## Links Pure **on images**

Links Pure can be placed on images, e.g. when using it as an additional link on image sliders or teaser images that are clickable themselves. In this case, the link pure can give the user an additional hint on the clickability of the whole image. Make sure to always use regular font-weight in links pure that are placed on images to provide legibility.

## **Additional subtext**

A link pure in 20 px or larger can be accompanied by an additional copytext with lower hierarchy. In this case, the copytext should be placed left-aligned with the link text in the link pure component.
