# Pagination

## Introduction
The pagination is used whenever a content (text, images, videos) is split into several pages. It provides information on the existing amount of pages, shows the current page position and allows the user to navigate between the single content pages. The pagination is the component of choice primarily for listed content (e.g. search results, archives etc.), where the user wants to find a specific item.

## UI / UX guidelines

### Styling
- The pagination is available for light (standard) and dark (inverted) background.
- It comes in 4 different sizes, containing either 1 item (for 1-page-content), 2 items (for 2-page-content), 5 items (for ≥ 5 pages) and 7 items (for ≥ 7 pages). The 7 item version is recommended to be used for device widths ≥ 480 px.
- The pagination should always be placed centered beneath the related content, keeping a minimum top spacing of 30 px.

### Interaction
- The arrows allow the user to skip to the previous or next page, thus they are interactive by default. When reaching the first or last content page, either the left or right arrow is disabled.
- The current page position is always indicated by a red bottom line. By default, the current page item is not clickable.
- If there are at least 8 pages, an ellipsis (three dots "...") is shown for a dedicated range of pages that are located inbetween the visible pagination numbers. The ellipsis is not clickable.

### Usability
- Each pagination item (arrows, numbers, ellipsis) spans over 40 x 40 px to guarantee a proper touch area also on mobile devices.
