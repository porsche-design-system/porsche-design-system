## **Content**

The Button Pure component includes the following sub-components:

- **Icon** The icon within the Button Pure component can be replaced by any icon available in the Porsche web icon set. Per default, an arrow right is set that should serve in most of all cases. It should only be changed if it is ensured that another symbol is more appropriate to support the text content, making it easier for the user to understand the function quickly.
- **Text label** The text label within the Button Pure component should be short and descriptive.

## Buttons Pure **on images**

Buttons Pure can be placed on images, e.g. when using it as an additional link on image sliders or teaser images that are clickable themselves. In this case, the button pure can give the user an additional hint on the clickability of the whole image. Make sure to always use regular font-weight in buttons pure that are placed on images to provide legibility.

## **Additional subtext**

A button pure in 20 px or larger can be accompanied by an additional copytext with lower hierarchy. In this case, the copytext should be placed left-aligned with the button text in the button pure component.

## Button Pure **groups**

Multiple buttons pure can be combined to one button pure group that must be stacked left-aligned in order to guarantee scanability and legibility. It is recommended to not group more than 6 buttons pure in a row.
