# Grid

The grid provides a visual system to create responsive layout with a homogeneous, balanced content placement across all Porsche web experiences and screen sizes.
It consists of the following elements:

- **The grid gutter** separates the columns horizontally by in-between-spacings. The gutter is defined with fixed pixel sizes and breakpoints to balance size ratios between elements on the respective screen size. 
- **The grid margins** define the outer spacings between the content area and the left and right screen sides. Grid margins are defined using percentages, going from 7% to 10% for screen widths larger than 1760 px. 
- **The grid colums** offers 12 columns for flexible adaption of the content to any screen size. It's width is based on percentages (resulting from total screen width minus gutter and margin width).

**For layouting on mobile** with screen widths lower than 759px, we foster using a 6-column-grid to avoid a too small-scaling or even „cluttering“.

### Overview
|   | px range | Columns | Gutter | Margin |
| -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- |
| **Mobile** | 320-759 px | 12 columns (Design only: 6 columns) |  16 px | 7% |
| **Tablet** | 760-1023 px | 12 columns |  24 px | 7% |
|  | 1024-1299 px | 12 columns | 36 px| 7% |
| **Desktop** | 1300-1759 px  |  12 columns | 36 px | 7% | 
|  | 1760 px or larger |  12 columns | 36 px | 10% | 

## Grid Breakpoints
Breakpoints are the defined steps at which the content is adapted to fit the different screen sizes.
For Porsche we use the following main breakpoints representing the latest screen size analytics data: 

- 760 px
- 1000 px 
- 1300 px
- 1760 px

### Breakpoint usage

It is highly recommended to stick to the defined breakpoints especially for general elements like e.g. header or footer.

As for other components or modules, not each and every breakpoint is necessarily to be used. And also vice-versa: In case more breakpoints are needed for a specific component, you are free to add more. If you do so, please make sure that all additional breakpoints must have a minimum difference of 100 px to the existing main breakpoints (in order to avoid „breakpoint overload“).

Optimizing for defined viewport sizes
Due to statistical usage of specific devices, all Porsche web layouts should be optimized for the following viewport sizes: 

- 320 / 375 px
- 768 px
- 1024 px
- 1366 px
- 1920 px

The main breakpoints (see above) are deliberately chosen with some distance to the optimized device sizes due to a higher fault tolerance.

### Layout template
To make layouting from scratch as easy as possible, the optimized viewport sizes are provided as artboard templates for Sketch. They come with final layout settings that can be turned visible via: View → Canvas → Show Layout.

### Viewport range
In order to provide consistency throughout all Porsche web experiences, all layouts should be optimized for a viewport range from **320 px** to a maximum of **1920 px**. For viewport sizes from 1920 px onwards, a growing white space outside the left and right edge should be used.

## Tips for responsive layouting

### Use the grid purposefully.
All content elements that should behave responsively should be placed horizontally within the grid, always starting in a column. The spacing between content elements is therefore defined by the grid gutter. 
In most cases, this should refer to modules or content boxes, whereas smaller spaces on a more or less „micro-level“ (both vertical and horizontal) should be defined by using the [Spacing]() component.

### Know the possibilities. But use them wisely.
When it comes to designing a component or module responsively, there are several screws that can be turned to adapt to different screen sizes, such as changing…

- … the component’s grid column width and, therefore, it’s wrapping behaviour. Example: A 3-column-text on desktop, each column using 4 grid columns, can be stacked on mobile, using 12 grid columns.
- … text sizes – commonly using smaller text on mobile, larger text on bigger screens.
- … the general layout of the component by using different patterns on mobile and desktop. Example: Turning a multi-column teaser module on desktop into an accordion on mobile.

In designing for responsive layout, always aim to find the solution that works best for the specific case, keeping the user and the specific context of use in mind.

### Don’t be afraid to think out of the box.
It is possible to place elements end-to-end, spanning from left to the right edge of the screen. For example a full-width-image that generates a more emotional and concise side entry. Though this should be a well-thought exception.

Also, for image groups it is possible to break out of the grid in order to create a stronger visual coherence. The outer edges (left and right) of the images group should always be placed within the grid, whereas the edges inbetween the single images can be placed exactly in the middle of the gutter.
