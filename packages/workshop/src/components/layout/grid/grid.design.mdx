## Recommendation of use

The grid is a fixed component in the digital Porsche layout. It provides a visual system consisting of a defined number of columns that allow a homogeneous, balanced content placement with standardised horizontal spacings defined by the grid gutter.

The flexible grid is the central tool to provide a responsive layout by defining a specific number of grid columns for modules or elements for different viewport sizes. Therefore, the grid is a mandatory part of every digital layout process and should always be kept in mind when designing Porsche web experiences.

## Grid layout and behaviour

The number of grid columns differs for the different viewports. Generally, it is based on 12 columns that is dividable by 2, 3, 4 and 6 and therefore allows a high layout flexibility:

- ≤ 759 px: 6 columns (valid for UI design only, technically 12 columns)
- ≥ 760 px: 12 columns

**Grid gutter:**

- ≤ 759 px: 16 px
- 760-999 px: 24 px
- ≥ 1000 px: 36 px

**Margin column:**

- ≤ 1759 px: 7%
- ≥ 1760 px: 10%

## Main Breakpoints & optimized layout sizes

- The main breakpoints for all Porsche web experiences are: 760 px / 1000 px / 1300 px and 1760 px. They are based on statistical data on browser size usage and binding, especially for general elements like e.g. header or footer.
- Depending on the specific component or module, not each and every breakpoint is necessarily to be used. In case more breakpoints are needed for a specific component, you are free to add more. Please make sure that all additional breakpoints must have a minimum difference of 100 px to the existing main breakpoints.
- Based on the main breakpoints, all Porsche web layouts are to be optimized for the following viewport sizes: 320, 375, 768, 1024, 1366 and 1920 px width.

## Layouting

- Content elements should be placed within the grid, always starting in a column.
- It is possible to place elements outside the grid, e.g. browser-width pictures. This should be a well thought out exception.
