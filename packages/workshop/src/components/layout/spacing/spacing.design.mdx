# Spacing

We use defined spacings to seperate components elements within a layout. Using the same defined spacing system provides a consistent and familiar user experience across all pages. For layouts the spacing should be used in combination with the [responsive grid](#/layout/grid).

## 8 px spacing system - the Porsche formula
We use a 8 px square grid system across all viewports to define dimensions, padding and margin of block and inline elements. The grid unit of 8 px refers to
the general base size of 16 px (= 1 em), that is also applied in typography and other component sizes.

## Applying the 8 px system

- **Margins and paddings** are applied based on multiples of 8 px. Boxed UI elements are sized either by adapting to the fixed value or to the [fluid column widths](#/layout/grid).
- **Typography as an exception** works with a baseline unit of 4 px for larger flexibility while ensuring the overall consistent rhythm.

## Fixed and flexible spacings

The Porsche UI Kit provides both fixed and flexible spacing. The two systems are built on the same definitions to complement the overall consistency but serve different roles. Additional increments can be added for specific needs as long as the 8 px spacing system is followed.

### Fixed spacing 
Spacings that do not need to change across different screen sizes.

### Flexible spacing 
Spacings that change in accordance with the screen size at defined breakpoint widths.

|  | 320 - 759 px | 760 - 999 px | 1000 - 1299 px | 1300 - 1759 px | 1760  px or larger  |
| -------- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **spacing-a** | 4 px  | 8 px  | 12 px | 16 px | 20 px |
| **spacing-b** | 8 px  | 16 px | 24 px | 32 px | 40 px |
| **spacing-c** | 16 px | 24 px | 32 px | 40 px | 48 px |
| **spacing-d** | 24 px | 32 px | 40 px | 48 px | 56 px |
| **spacing-e** | 32 px | 40 px | 48 px | 56 px | 64 px |
| **spacing-f** | 40 px | 48 px | 56 px | 64 px | 72 px |
| **spacing-g** | 48 px | 56 px | 64 px | 72 px | 80 px |

Example: Mixed use of fixed, flexible and custom spacings.

## Working with space
Spacing is a powerful design element and an integral part of every layout, which
can create relationships, hierarchy and rhythm between components.

### Relationships

The space between components can determine if the elements seem to have a
meaningful connection. The closer elements are placed to each other, the
stronger their relationship gets. This is also valid for repetitive spacing
patterns: The use of the same space between several elements makes them appear
equivalent. This fact should be used for example to group contents that are
informatively related. 

### Hierarchy

Different spaces between elements or info sections help to create different
relevances and, therefore, a meaningful hierarchy within the site. Elements that
have more space around tend to be perceived as being more important and
hierarchically higher.

Creating hierarchy on the page supports user guidance and helps separating and
organizing elements.

### White space (also: negative space)

Within Porsche web applications, we use white space generously (but
well-considered) to emphasise the brand’s exclusiveness and high quality. In
addition, white space supports a good UX, as long as it is used carefully. For
example, space between elements can be used to create content sections and,
therefore, to set the focus on specific elements. Try to avoid crowded pages and
let both the content breathe and the user’s eye relax by using deliberate white
spacing.

## Usage in Sketch

### Define the grid
The Porsche UI Kit basically works with 8 px increments, but in few cases 4 px
values are allowed, for example when it comes to the line-height-rhythm of
typography or, simply, when spacing-4 is needed between elements. Therefore, we
recommend setting up the Sketch workspace with a 4 px grid system. You can
change the Sketch grid settings via: View → Canvas → Grid Settings → Grid Block
Size: 4 px. Or, when setting up a totally new UI design file, feel free to use
the [Porsche UI Kit layout template](http://ui.porsche.com/latest/porsche-ui-kit-layout-template.sketch) with predefined settings.

### Snap to grid
Most design apps have the option to snap elements to the grid. Using this
feature will help position elements faster in the layout.

### Nudging
To make the UI design workflow as smooth as possible, it is helpful to adjust
the nudging (= increments an element moves when using keyboard arrows) to the
grid steps in use. We recommend the following settings, reachable via Sketch
settings → Canvas.

- Move objects **1 px** using Arrow keys. 
- Move objects **8 px** using Shift-Arrow keys.

## Design tools vs. web browser

### Translating Sketch spacings into variables 

When it comes to design-to-dev-handover, we should always keep in mind that the handling of
spacings is different: Whereas the designer sets the spacings manually in Sketch
layouts, the developer implements them by using pre-defined spacing variables
(e.g. spacing-8 or spacing-16). Therefore, we should always make sure that the
spacings in sketch are set as correctly as possible and that they the developer
can easily read them in Abstract's inspect mode - of course, a personal
conversation between designer and developer is always the best way to get
optimal results. Last but not least a one-on-one is indispensable when it comes
to spacings, as the developer might not know when to use a fixed or flexible
spacing class (e.g. 8 px on mobile might as well be spacing-8 or spacing-b).

### Borders

While in Sketch the border doesn't add to the shape size, browsers
consider borders as solid space around elements by default. We recommend to
ignore this fact while designing and to always set the focus on giving the developer
the right spacing sizes between or inside elements, even if this results in
slightly higher elements in implementation due to the additional border.

![Handling borders in Sketch](assets/workshop/layout/spacing/assets/spacings-borders.png)

### Lines

Lines (such as dividers or separators) can be created in multiple ways. We
recommend creating lines with the native „line“ tool in Sketch (L), as using
narrow rectangles (R) leads to wrong spacings in the developer’s inspect mode.

### Text boxes

In development, the vertical size of a text line or paragraph results from its
surrounding bounding box, that includes not only the text size, but also
line-height measures. So, when working with typography, we should always place
the text box within the grid parameters, even if the baseline of the typography
is not on the grid line.

### How to handle uneven image heights
It is no rocket science setting the correct 8 px spacing values when the element
heights correspond to the 4 px grid themselves. But there is an exception, where
element heights don’t fit in perfectly: Images. They can be displayed in many
different aspect ratios (such as 16:9 or 4:3) and follow various rules for
handling responsiveness (like cropping or resizing). Depending on their width
and the screen size, their height will most likely not fit in the 4 px grid. To
follow a consistent rule, we recommend to always place the upper part (X/Y
value) on the grid system, even if the bottom part doesn’t fit. The following
element underneath should then be placed on the grid line again. As for the
implementation of the spacing, the developer should use the spacing variable
with the value closest to it. For example, the following design case might lead
to an implemented spacing value of 16 px, as this the spacing variable the most
close to 18 px.
