# Text

Typography plays an important role for the general brand impression and is indispensable for the use in digital applications -
not to say: Typography **is** the interface (just image the porsche.com without any text).

The special Porsche feeling is decisively shaped by the use of the corporate typeface "Porsche Next".
Being part of a high-class layout the typeface communicates the brand values of modernism, clarity and functionality
and, speaking of digital usage, supports both content structure and a good readability.

For UI applications different type style classes are provided, following a straight-forward scaling system.

## Typeface: Porsche Next

The Porsche Next is the only typeface allowed to be used for Porsche in both print and digital media. It has been exclusively developed for
Porsche combining the brand values of design and performance with good legibility.
Its shape follows the typical Porsche lines and unites the exclusive, high-classy, yet very sportive brand image, resulting in a high recognisability.
Formally, the impression of the Porsche Next is largely determined by the visual character of the "squircle", a combination of square and circle
which is reflected in the curves and circular shapes of the typeface.

## Type scale

The Porsche type scale is a dedicated sizing system based on a specific formula.

12 px 16 px 20 px  24 px 28 px 30 px 32 px 36 px 42 px 44 px 48 px 52 px 60 px 62 px 72 px 84 px

❌ TBD: ABBILDUNG TYPE SCALE FORMEL? ❌

### Type scale calculator

The vast majority of font sizes required for your UI designs should be covered with the provided font size classes.
Nevertheless there might be specific cases in which you need additional sizes larger than 84 px (smaller sizes than 12 px should be avoided for legibility reasons).

- Umgang mit versch. weights
- Hinweis: H1 muss nicht zwangsläufig headline-1 sein!

### Headlines

The Porsche headline styles should only be used for first-level headlines whose function is to lead a page, section or content area.
All Porsche headlines styles use bold to provide a good readability and make it easy as possible to focus on the content sections of a page.
Likewise, bold perfectly embodies the brand's claim to modernism, power and strength.

Please note that the headline class namings don't necessarily refer to the SEO-relevant HTML font tag.
For example the style HEADLINE-1 can also be implemented as `<h2>`.


|                  | 320 - 759 px (XS)     | 760 - 999 px (S)   | 1000 - 1299 px (M)   | 1300 - 1759 px (L)   | 1760  px or larger (XL)   |
|------------------|---------------------  |------------------	|-------------------   |-------------------   |------------------------   |
| Headline-1       |                       |                 	|                      |                      |                           |
| Headline-2       |                       |                 	|                      |                      |                           |
| Headline-3       |                       |                 	|                      |                      |                           |
| Headline-4       |                       |                 	|                      |                      |                           |
| Headline-5       |                       |                 	|                      |                      |                           |


❌ BEISPIEL HEADLINE ❌


#### Headline-subline-combinations

A first-level headline can be supplemented by a corresponding subline. Make sure to stick to the following rules when using sublines:

- Sublines must be set in Regular, using a "Additional sizes" class.
- The subline size must be at least two sizing steps smaller than the corresponding headline.

❌ BEISPIEL HEADLINE-SUBLINE-KOMBI ❌


### Copytext

The Porsche copytext styles are typically to be used for long-form writing. Per default, you should stick to the Copytext class (16 px).
Copytext Small (12 px) is only recommended for additional, low-informative text such as disclaimers or captions.

|                 | FONT SIZE       | AVAILABLE STATES        |
|---------------- |
| Copytext        |
| Copytext        |


❌ BEISPIEL COPY / SMALL MIT HIGHLIGHT / STATES ❌

### Additional sizes

## Font styling


### Font weights

The Porsche Next is available in different font weights, but only the following are used in the digital environment:

- **Porsche Next Bold** for first-level headlines or copytext highlights.
- **Porsche Next Regular** for copytext, stand-alone text or sublines (in combination with first-level headlines).
- **Porsche Next Thin** for stand-alone text larger than 20 px.

❌ ABBILDUNG BOLD, REGULAR, THIN ❌


### Text alignment

Per default, the Porsche Next is always used left-aligned. In individual cases or certain components it can also be used centered
(keep in mind not to exeed 3 text lines, as it is much harder to read) or, even more rarely, right-aligned.

Avoid…

- … using the font in block typesetting, as this does not correspond with the high-quality brand image.
- … mixing up different text alignments within one paragraph. Keep it straight and simple.

### Text color

The color to be used for Porsche Next depends on the [Porsche Color Theme](#/basic/color) in use.
In order to support both simplicity and and legibility (sufficient contrast) text is either to be set in Porsche Black or Porsche Light.
For copytext sizes the Porsche type set also provides different text state color, such as Porsche Red for active states or Grey for disabled text.


### Line length

The longer a text line gets, the harder it is for the user to jump from the end of the current line to the beginning of the next line.
Therefore we should always aim at a line length that supports good readability.

For UI applications it is recommended to use [no more than 80 characters or glyphs per line](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/visual-audio-contrast-visual-presentation.html).
This might differ a bit depending on the respective line height and viewport size and results in different pixel widths depending on the Porsche type class in use:

- Copytext Small (12 px): max. 400-450 px
- Copytext (16 px): max. 500-550 px
- Headlines and additional sizes (20-84 px): max. 700 up to max. 2700 px


### Multi-column text

Text paragraphs should always preferably be set as single column. Multi-column text should never acceed 3 columns and is only allowed when it can be
ensured that all text columns are in the visible viewport range ("above the fold"). The user should not have to scroll before being able
to read the full content.

### Paragraph spacing



❌ ABBILDUNG PARAGRAPH SPACING ❌


### Modifications

Please avoid to transform the Porsche Next manually (e.g. within Sketch or via CSS), as this would have a big and undesirable
impact on the origin character of the company typeface. This includes:

- No change of letter-spacing.
- No use of (drop) shadows on text.
- No formal change of letters (for example distortion).
- No use of outline borders on text.
- No use of small capitals.
- No use of opacity for text colors.
