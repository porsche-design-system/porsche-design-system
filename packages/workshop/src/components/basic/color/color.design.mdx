# Color

Together with other basic elements like typography, iconography or imagery, the
right use of color gives every UI the specific Porsche feeling and is
therefore one of the most important tools to create a consistent visual
branding. Even more so when it comes to UX, color is to be used intentionally to create
patterns, set emphasis on important elements and by doing so, to provide visual
guidance and information.

The Porsche UI color system provides a general UI color palette as well as two
Porsche UI color themes that are based on the Porsche color palette and to be
used for different visual environments.

## Porsche UI color themes

When designing Porsche UI applications, the first decision to make is
whether the content should be displayed in a merely light or dark environment.
That's when the Porsche color themes come into play: You can either chose
between the **Porsche Light Theme** (which is preferably to be used) or the
**Porsche Dark Theme**.

Depending on which Porsche theme you're using you should stick to a limited
color set deriving from the Porsche UI color palette as these colors are
optimized to match accessibility (Level AA) criteria within the specific theme
(except for [colors for inactive or decorative text](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#contrast-minimum)). Accordingly, the
components provided within the Porsche UI Kit are optimized for and structured
in the different Porsche UI color themes.

Within certain limits it's allowed to mix the Porsche color themes: Let's say,
for example, you could integrate a limited Dark Theme area in your Light Theme
to visually distinguish the footer from the content. Always make sure that the
vast majority of the screen consists of the initially chosen theme.

## Designing with color

Here are some tipps on how you should define and work with color within your Porsche UI design process:

### Step 1: Theme
Decide together with your team which **Porsche color theme** you want to go for,
taking into account different factors such as target group, user flow (entry and
exit of your application) or business goals, for example. When in doubt, for web
applications the Porsche Light Theme should be the first choice. Once you've
selected a color theme stick with it throughout your whole application to ensure
consistency.

### Step 2: Setup
Set up your layout using the **page background color** of your Porsche color
theme of choice. To start quickly you can use the [Sketch layout template](http://ui.porsche.com/latest/porsche-ui-kit-layout-template.sketch)
that provides both light and dark themed artboards. 

### Step 3: Information level

To define the colors to be used within in the screen you should check the
**information level** of the respective elements.

Some general rules:

- Play with darker/lighter grey shades to make a surface stand out from the page background or the surface underneath or to set emphasize on elements to create visual tension or reinforce information hierarchy within the UI. The lighter/darker the color is, the more importance it gets.
- For large screen space make sure to only use the dedicated surface color for your theme (e.g. Surface Light). Just let the proportional scale of the theme guide you.
- For small screen space, such as tiles or other graphical elements, you can use more grey shades. Stick either to the accessibility-safe additional colors of your chosen theme
(highly recommended for informative content) or, for decorative purposes, to any other grey shade from the Porsche Neutral Colors.
- Use Porsche Red only for highlighting single elements.

## Color principles

### Be consistent.
Once you’ve picked a **Porsche color theme** for you UI design you should stick with it within the application.
Ensure consistency by integrating audits in your workflow.

### Be accessible.
Always keep in mind that **not every user gets to experience colors the same way**
due to color blindness, visual impairment or simply because of the environment.
Therefore, you should always care about accessibility.

### Be purposeful.
Use color wisely and always **focus on supporting the user’s needs** and the purpose of the content within the UI.

### Be Porsche.
Generate a dedicated **Porsche feeling** within the UI by using the colors given
in the brand color palette. Avoid using shades or opacity values for the brand
colors.

Sticking to the [Porsche Brand Code](https://brandguide.porsche.com/elements/manual/view/id/548) this means:

- Generous (but also well-considered) use of white (or, when using the Porsche Dark Theme, dark grey) space to emphasise the brand’s exclusiveness and high quality.
- Form follows function – and so does color.
- Use color to support a clean, precise design language. Stick to the essentials and avoid a non-functional decorative use of color.

## Accessibility

In order to make content accessible for a wide range of people and, by doing so, to improve the product’s usability in general, we stick to the common [WCAG 2.1 Standard](#/basics/accessibility).
when designing Porsche web applications.

- Always ensure a sufficient contrast ratio. The combination of text and
background color should pass the WCAG AA standard and have a contrast ratio of
at least 4.5:1 for standard text size and 3:1 for larger text sizes.

![Porsche color accessibility examples](assets/workshop/basic/color/assets/color-accessibility-01.png)

- Combinations of other colored elements must pass the WCAG AA standard of a minimum 3:1 ratio, unless it's only a decorative element.

![Porsche color accessibility examples](assets/workshop/basic/color/assets/color-accessibility-02.png)

- Don’t rely on color only to convey information (for example when displaying
status or error messages). This is of high importance especially in critical
cases, e.g. when displaying safety-relevant vehicle data.


### Helpful tools and resources
There are a few little gadgets that support you in ensuring the desired level of accessibility, for example:

#### Sketch plugins
- [Stark](https://getstark.co)
- [Color Contrast Analyser](https://github.com/getflourish/Sketch-Color-Contrast-Analyser)

Both plugins help you to check the color contrast of two selected layers in Sketch, no matter if it's text or surface color.

#### Web tools
- [Color Oracle](https://colororacle.org/) is a free color blindness simulator for both Windows and Mac, that gives you an impression on how your designs are perceived by visually impaired users.
-  With [Tanaguru Contrast Finder](http://contrast-finder.tanaguru.com/) you can easily check color contrasts on your desired level of accessibility.
