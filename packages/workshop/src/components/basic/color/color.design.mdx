# Color

Together with other basic elements like typography, iconography or imagery, the
right use of color gives every UI the specific ”Porsche feeling“ and is,
therefore, one of the most important tools to create a consistent visual
branding. 

Even more so when it comes to UX, color is to be used intentionally to create
patterns, set emphasis on important elements and by doing so provide visual
guidance and information.

The Porsche UI color system provides both a branded color palette and specific
color themes to be used for different backgrounds . 

## Porsche UI Color Palette
They Porsche UI Colors must always be used in full tone (100% opacity).

### Brand Colors
The Porsche Brand colors are the core of the Porsche Color Palette. 
The usage and proportion of Brand Colors within a UI is defined by the specific Porsche Color Theme in use.

|               	|                    	| HEX     	| RGB         	|
|---------------	|-----------------------|---------	|-------------	|
| [Color Badge] 	| **Porsche Red**      	| #D5001C 	| 213/0/28    	|
| [Color Badge] 	| **Porsche Dark Red**	| #960014 	| 150/0/20    	|
| [Color Badge] 	| **Porsche Light**    	| #FFFFFF 	| 255/255/255 	|
| [Color Badge] 	| **Surface Light**    	| #F2F2F2 	| 242/242/242 	|
| [Color Badge] 	| **Surface Dark**     	| #1A2023 	| 26/32/35    	|
| [Color Badge] 	| **Porsche Dark**     	| #0E1418 	| 14/20/24    	|
| [Color Badge] 	| **Porsche Black**    	| #000000 	| 0/0/0       	|



### Neutral Colors
The Neutral Palette is to be used for all **basic architectonic page elements**
– going from tile background colors to text or icon colors. Depending on the Porsche Color Theme 
in use you can either play with lighter or darker shades of grey to set emphasize on elements
or to create visual tension or reinforce information hierarchy within the UI.

The basic set consists of **8 grey shades** that are based on a pre-defined mixing ratio of black 
(with reduced opacity in steady increments) in combination with a touch of blue.

1. Theming wählen
2. Informationslevel


### Be consistent.
Once you’ve picked a Porsche Color Theme for you UI design, you should stick with it within the application. 
Ensure consistency by integrating audits in your workflow.

### Be accessible.
Always keep in mind that not every user gets to experience colors the same way
due to color blindness, visual impairment or simply because of the environment.
Therefore, you should always care about accessibility.

### Be purposeful.
Use color wisely and always focus on supporting the user’s needs and the purpose of the content within the UI. 

### Be Porsche.
Generate a dedicated ”Porsche feeling“ within the UI by using the colors given
in the brand color palette. Avoid using shades or opacity values for the brand
colors. 

Sticking to the [Porsche Brand Code](https://brandguide.porsche.com/elements/manual/view/id/548) this means:

- Generous (but also well-considered) use of white space to emphasise the brand’s exclusiveness and high quality. 
- ”Form follows function“ – and so does color. 
- Use color to support a clean, precise design language. Stick to the essentials and avoid a non-functional decorative use of color.




## Accessibility

In order to make content accessible for a wide range of people and - by doing so - 
to improve the product’s usability in general, we stick to the common [WCAG Standard](#/basics/accessibility). 
when designing Porsche web applications.

- Always ensure a sufficient contrast ratio. The combination of text and
background color should pass the WCAG AA standard and have a contrast ratio of
at least 4.5:1 for standard text size and 3:1 for larger text sizes.

- Combinations of other colored elements (such as background color or single
elements like lines) must pass the WCAG AA standard of a minimum 3:1 ratio. 

- Don’t rely on color only to convey information (for example when displaying
status or error messages). This is of high importance especially in critical
cases, e.g. when displaying safety-relevant vehicle data.

### Helpful tools and resources
There are a few little helpers that support you in ensuring the desired level of accessibility:

#### Sketch plugins
[Stark](https://getstark.co) and [Color Contrast Analyser](https://github.com/getflourish/Sketch-Color-Contrast-Analyser)
are two common plugins that help you to check the color contrast of two selected layers in Sketch, 
no matter if it's text or surface color. On top, Stark also provides a color blindness simulator that 
gives you the impression how your design is perceived by a visually impaired person.
