# Typography

Typography plays an important role for the general brand impression and is indispensable for the use in digital applications - 
not to say: Typography **is** the interface (just image the porsche.com without any text).

The special Porsche feeling is decisively shaped by the use of the corporate typeface "Porsche Next".
Being part of a high-class layout the typeface communicates the brand values of modernism, clarity and functionality
and, speaking of digital usage, supports both content structure and a good readability.

For UI applications different type style classes are provided, following a straight-forward scaling system 
which is adapted to the general 8 px sizing system.

## Typeface: Porsche Next

The Porsche Next has been exclusively developed for Porsche combining the brand values of design and performance with good legibility.
Its shape follows the typical Porsche lines and unites the exclusive, high-classy, yet very sportive brand image, resulting in a high recognisability.

The Porsche Next is the only typeface allowed to be used for Porsche in both print and digital media.

### Language versions

The Porsche Next contains all the typeface characters required for European, Greek and Cyrillic languages in a single file, all of which are
available in the same font weights.

For Arabic, Indo-Aryan, Indo-Germanic and Persian characters, a second typeface pack is available to be used for languages such as
Arabic, Pashtu, Persian and Urdu.

### Font weights

The Porsche Next is available in different font weights, but only the following are used in the digital environment:

- **Porsche Next Bold** for first-level headlines or highlights within copytext.
- **Porsche Next Regular** for copytext, stand-alone text or sublines (in combination with first-level headlines).
- **Porsche Next Thin** for stand-alone text larger than 20 px.

❌ ABBILDUNG BOLD, REGULAR, THIN ❌


### Text alignment

Per default, the Porsche Next is always used left-aligned. In individual cases or certain components, it can also be used centered or,
even more rarely, right-aligned. Please avoid using the font in block typesetting, as this does not correspond with the high-quality brand image.

### Text color

### Modifications

Please avoid to transform the Porsche Next manually (e.g. within Sketch or via CSS), as this would have a big and undesirable 
impact on the origin character of the company typeface. This includes:

- No change of letter-spacing.
- No use of (drop) shadows on text.
- No formal change of letters (for example distortion).
- No use of outline borders on text.
- No use of small capitals.
