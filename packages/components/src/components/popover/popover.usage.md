# Popover

<TableOfContents></TableOfContents>

## When to use

- To display additional information that is not necessary for the task completion (User Flow).
- To give further explanation about workflow for better understandability.
- When it's not possible to show the content directly.

---

## Behavior

### Open

The popover will be triggered via `click` on the info
<p-icon name="information" aria="{ 'aria-label': 'Information icon' }"></p-icon>-button.

### Close

Both the `esc` key and `click` outside the popover will close it.

### Direction

It's possible to define a preferred direction in which the popover should open (`top`, `right`, `bottom` , and `left`),
given there is enough space in the viewport. Otherwise, it will be opened in the direction with the most available space
automatically.

## Usage

### Placement

- Position popovers, so they donâ€™t block related content.
- Use popovers consistently throughout your site.
