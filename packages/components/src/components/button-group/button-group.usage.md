<TableOfContents></TableOfContents>

## Usage

The following segment provides instructions for designers and developers regarding the appropriate utilization of this
component in various situations.

### Do:

- Use a Button Group to consistently align two or more buttons at once.
- Use Primary Button in combination with Button pure.
- Order buttons within a group horizontally or vertically, based on their priority. The most important button (primary)
  should be placed first on the left (horizontal) or top (vertical) of the group following the F pattern for optimal
  user experience.
- If no primary action is set, consider emphasizing up to two secondary actions to give them slightly higher priority.

### Don't:

- Don't use button groups with too many options, as this can overwhelm users and make it difficult for them to make a
  choice.
- Don't use button groups for unrelated actions or options, as this can confuse users and make it difficult for them to
  find what they're looking for.
