## Types

To ensure a seamless UX in all Porsche web applications it is recommended to use the Text List as follows

| Type | Usage |
|----|----|
| Unordered List  | Content with equal value is displayed in unordered lists. |
| Ordered List  | Sequenced content should be displayed in an ordered list.|

## Usage

### Order
Arrange list items in a logical way, e.g. from  highest to lowest level. If necessary (depending on the total length of the list) you should split the content into smaller and more specific categories and group them. 

### Writing style
It is recommended to stick to a homogeneous writing structure and style within one list. Avoid e.g. mixing active with passive voice or declarative with imperative sentences. 

### Capitalization
Use sentence-style capitalization for each list item. Capitalize only the first letter of the item.

## Do's & Don'ts

### Hierarchy

Text Lists should not exceed two hierarchy levels.
