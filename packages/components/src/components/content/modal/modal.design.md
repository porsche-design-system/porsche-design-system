# Modal

A modal dialog is a temporary overlay that takes focus from the page and requires people to interact with it. It’s primarily used for confirming actions, such as asking people to make a choice. It should be used thoughtfully and sparingly.

## Usage

### Overlay
For the background overlay is used the shading background to provide the feeling of a third dimensional layer. 
This also eliminates distraction and helps the user focus on the modal content.

## Don'ts

### Don't use more than three buttons
There should be no more than 3 actions and no fewer than 1. Actions should always be located within an action bar at the bottom of the modal. 
Button order and positioning should follow our guidelines for buttons.

### Stacking modals
Modals shouldn’t launch other modals. Stacking modals makes it hard to dismiss them and confuses the user on their levels of importance.
