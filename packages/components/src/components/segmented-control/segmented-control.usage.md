## Usage

The following segment provides instructions for designers and developers regarding the appropriate utilization of this
component in various situations.

### Do:

- Use to present a set of selectable options at once.
- Use for selection from 2-5 short and consistent options.
- Use them over other selection controls to reduce cognitive load.
- Pair the option with an icon to improve visual recognition use.
- Use icons only when the context meaning is really clear.
- Use preselection when the result is visible by default.
- Use with no selection when a selection by the user is necessary to show the result.
- Use it with a short indication for the unit (such as km, â‚¬, %, or $) when possible.
- Use for horizontal and/or vertical display of options.

### Don't:

- Don't use it to filter or navigate content (use [Tabs](components/tabs) instead).
- Don't use it for more than 5 options (use the [Select](components/select-wrapper) component).
- Don't use it with mixed values (use [Radio Button](components/radio-button-wrapper) or [Select](components/select-wrapper) instead).
- Don't exceed maximum width so the values turn multiline.
