# Tabs

<TableOfContents></TableOfContents>

## When to use

- Use Tabs when there is a large amount of content that can be separated.
- Use Tabs to make the content accessible without reloading the page or compromising on space.

## Types

To ensure a seamless UX in all Porsche web applications it is recommended to use the Tabs as follows

| Type      | Usage                                                                                                                          |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Standard  | Standard (regular) will be used on a monochrome background.                                                                    |
| Highlight | Highlight (semi-bold) will be used on a polychrome background (e.g. on images) for better comprehensibility and accessibility. |
| Small     | Small are used to provide an additional level or for smaller viewports.                                                        |
| Medium    | Medium tabs are usually used in page header or for larger viewports.                                                           |

## Behavior

### Overflow

When a set of Tabs cannot fit on screen the tab bar becomes horizontal swibeable and navigable with arrows. To navigate
back and forth use the arrows.

## Usage

### Scalable

As Tabs can horizontally scroll, technically a UI could have as many tabs as needed. You should use no more than six
tabs.

### Text label

It is recommended to always keep the label short. Try not to use more than two words for a tab label.

### Navigation

Not be used for primary navigation.
