# Icon

We want to enable you to use the icons you need. Check the [Porsche Design System](https://icons.porsche.com/#/) for an appropriate icon you are looking for. If there is no match, we encourage you to build, test and use the icons you need. To help you meet the quality standards of Porsche, you will find the guidelines below.

Do you have an icon that is mandatory for several teams and purposes? We are happy to include it in the Porsche Design System. Feel free to get in touch with us on our [Porsche Design System Slack](https://porschedev.slack.com/archives/CT7AVHTTQ)

**Icon Quality Standards**

1. Metaphor and Appearance matches the Porsche icon environment

2. Quality assurance (grid, color, pixel, naming, metatags, export criteria)

3. User Testing (Recognition, Information scent)

## Metaphor and Appearance

- Check the Porsche environment for similar or close icons to adapt (Web, App, In Car, Print).
- Stick to the basic geometric shapes.
- Default Porsche icons are based on 1px lines.
- Use easy and commonly known metaphors.
- Keep the details and complexity to a minimum.

## Quality assurance

- Build your icons based on the default grid (24x24px). 
- Snap pixels to the grid to ensure a sharp visual appearance (prevents blurred lines because of anti-aliasing on low-resolution displays).
- Icons with a centered vertical or horizontal 1px stroke must be placed 1px off to the left and/or top.
- Try to balance the icons width and height for uniformed appearance in icon groups.
- Respect the safe area around the icon (approximately 2px, can vary depending on ratio of icon).
- Check your design in reference with other icons from the Porsche Design System.
- Make sure corresponding icons have the same position e.g. the "add" and "remove" icon.
- Design with only one color.

**SVG Export Guideline**

- Transform vector forms in a full, coherent vector shape. (convert strokes to shapes and merge objects)
- Delete everything that is not necessary (layers, strokes, variants, etc.).
- Export your icon as svg.
- Name svg according to the icons (e.g. "delete.svg" or "edit.svg"). Name social icons "logo-companyname.svg".
- We recommend running your svg through an optimizer to gain pure semantic code. Online SVG Optimizer: [Vecta](https://vecta.io/nano)

## User Testing

We want to ensure that icons are perceived in the intended way. To test icons for recognition and information scent we provide a simple Usabilityhub-Template. This is also required when moving icons to the Porsche Design System. Further, we highly recommend testing the icons in the specific use case.
