# Icon

We want to enable you to use the icons you need. Check the Porsche icon library for appropriate icon you are searching for. If there is no match we encourage you to build,  test, and use the icons you need. To help you to meet the quality standards you will find our guidelines for designing icons below.

Do you have an icon that is in your opinion mandatory for several teams and purposes? We are happy to include it in the basic icon library. Feel free to contact the Porsche Design System.


**Icon Quality Standarts**

1. Metaphor and Appearance matches the Porsche icon environment

2. Quality assurance (grid, color, pixel, naming, metatags, export criteria)

3. User Testing (Recognition, Information scent)

## Metaphor and Appearance

- Check the Porsche environment for similar or close icons to adapt (Web, App, In Car, Print).
- Use easy and commonly known metaphors.
- Stick to the basic geometric shapes.
- Rounded shapes are based on the curves capital "O" of Porsche Next Regulars.
- Default Porsche icons are based on 1px lines.
- Filled parts or filled icons are allowed for better visibility or to provide different states of an icon (e.g. active, passive).
- To Ensure a light weight appeal, keep the details and complexity to a minimum. Create a balance between negative and white space.

## Quality assurance

- Make sure to build your icons based on the default size grid with 24x24px. 
- Snap pixels to the grid to ensure a sharp visual appearance (blurred due to anti-aliasing of low-resolution displays).
- Try to balance the icons with and height for uniformed appearance in icon groups.
- Respect the safe area around the icon (e.g. maximum icon size approx. 20x20px).
- Icons with a centered vertical or horizontal 1px stroke must be placed 1px off to the left and/or top.
- Make sure corresponding icons have the same position e.g. example, the "add" and "remove" icon.
- Only use one color for an icon.

## User Testing

We want to ensure that icons are perceived in an intended way. To test icons for recognition and information scent we provide a simple and easy-to-use Usabulityhub-Template. This is also required when moving icons to the basic icon repository. Further, we highly recommend testing used icons in your specific use case.

**SVG Export Guideline**

- Make sure there is only one layer with one icon in your file.
- Delete everything in your file that is not necessary.
- Transform the vector forms in a full, coherent vector shape. (convert strokes to shapes and merch objects)
- export your icon as svg (Illustrator -> Export/For Screens)
- Name icon according to the containing icons (e.g. "delete" or "edit") and social icons with "logo-companyname.svg"
- For a clean svg-code the only attributes necessary are: `xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="100%" height="100%"`
