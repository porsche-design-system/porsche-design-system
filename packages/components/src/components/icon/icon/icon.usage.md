## Look & feel

The clean style of the Porsche icon set matches the Porsche brand aesthetically and creates a consistent look and feel
across all products and platforms. Each icon is reduced to its minimal form reflecting essential characteristics. By
following the typical Porsche lines and uniting the exclusive, high-classy and very sportive brand image, the Porsche
icons provide a high recognizability and readability, even in very small sizes.

## Usage

### Base area & grid

All icons are placed on a transparent 24x24 pixel base area, including a dedicated safe zone.

The icons themselves are built upon a base grid structure and guidelines for sizing the different icon shapes. These
scale guidelines ensure that each icon has the same visual weight so they all feel the same size, regardless of their
overall shape.

### Interactive

For interactive icons you should use the [Button Pure](components/button-pure) that comes with a dedicated click/touch
area and with different states.

### Color

The icons come with standard colors you should stick to. However, when you decide to override the default icon colors
for special reasons, it is recommended to use the color(s) uniformly throughout your application to provide consistency.

### Context

Icons can stand alone as visual symbols or in combination with text. Either way, always keep in mind that a semantic
element can have different meanings depending on the context it is put into, such as within different labels.
