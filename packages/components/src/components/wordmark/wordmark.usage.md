# Wordmark

<TableOfContents></TableOfContents>

## Do's & Don'ts

### Do

- Use the `p-wordmark` as the main brand identifier.
- Use the `p-wordmark` only in dedicated situations, like global navigation.
- Position the `p-wordmark` centered whenever possible.
- Use the crest only as an additional small brand identifier (e.g., within contact cards).
- Switch from the `p-wordmark` to the crest on small viewports below 480px (automatically implemented in global
  navigation and footer).

### Don't

- Use the crest as the primary brand identifier by default.
- Display the `p-wordmark` too often (usually once is enough).
