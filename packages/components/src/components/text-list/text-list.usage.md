## Types

To ensure a seamless UX in all Porsche web applications it is recommended to use the Text List as follows

| Type           | Usage                                                     |
| -------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| Unordered List | Content with equal value is displayed in unordered lists. |
| Ordered List   | Sequenced content should be displayed in an ordered list. |

## Usage

### Order

Arrange list items in a logical way, e.g. from highest to lowest level. If necessary (depending on the total length of
the list) you should split the content into smaller and more specific categories and group them.

### Writing style

It is recommended to stick to a homogeneous writing structure and style within one list. Avoid e.g. mixing active with
passive voice or declarative with imperative sentences.

### Capitalization

Use sentence-style capitalization for each list item. Capitalize only the first letter of the item.

## Do's & Don'ts

### Hierarchy

Text Lists should not exceed two hierarchy levels.
