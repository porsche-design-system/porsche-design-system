# Link

<TableOfContents></TableOfContents>

## Usage

The following segment provides instructions for designers and developers regarding the appropriate utilization of this
component in various situations.

### Do:

- Use a Link to navigate to another page.
- Use a [Button](components/button) instead of a Link if you want to change a state (e.g. send form)
- Use a Primary Link filled for one or two high-priority actions within a page.
- Use a Secondary Link for all other stand-alone Links that aren't high priority.
- Use a [Link Pure](components/link-pure) as a subordinated link version in combination with a filled link (primary or
  secondary) or stand-alone when the priority of the action is lower compared to all other link actions within the page.
- Use an Icon and text variant only when appropriate (e.g. external link).
- Use an Icon-only variant only in cases where the user is fully aware of the link function.
- Ensure that the link remains legible even in a multiline state by using max. 100 characters per line.

### Don't:

- Don't use a Primary Link for all links on a page.
- Don't use a multiline Link as it's recommended to keep the text label short and avoid multiline Links.
- Don't use a width that's too wide and makes the link difficult to read.
