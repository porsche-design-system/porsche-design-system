# Marque

The marque gives the Porsche brand a distinctive look, sets it apart from others within the overall external image and represents the quality of the product. 

## Variants

### Marque with registered trademark (速)
In web applications for the United States and/or Canada as well as with international purpose *including* United States and/or Canada, the Porsche marque must always be used with the 速. The 速 is optimized to match the respective crest size.
