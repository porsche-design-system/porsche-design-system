## Sizes

Slight adjustments ensure that the Porsche marque is optimally perceived as equally as possible in the various image
sizes.

| ---------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| **Small**  | Viewports with 1299 px width or lower     |

## Content

The two elements that make up the overall logo for the Porsche marque are the **word "Porsche" (logotype)** and the
**Porsche Crest** as an image-based logo. The three-dimensional colored Porsche marque is used as a fixed unit, always
including crest and logotype, across all media, and **may not be changed**.

---

## Usage

- Within static digital applications, the Porsche Marque is **always used without shadow**. For moving images a separate
  Crest with shadow is available.
- The Porsche Marque may **only be used on a white background**.

---

## Do's & Don'ts

- The marque **may not be altered** in relation to its two elements or their size. The marque may never be used without
  the Porsche lettering, as the sender identification cannot be guaranteed.
- The Porsche marque **may not be used against coloured or busy backgrounds** (e.g. shading). As the Porsche crest has a
  high level of graphical complexity, excessive visual turmoil may be created.
