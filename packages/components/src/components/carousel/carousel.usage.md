### Navigation

Navigate through either the previous and next arrows placed next to each other above the carousel (only on desktop) or
by dragging/swiping the slider container.

### Rotation

When clicking the next arrow after the end of the set of slides is reached, the carousel will then animate seamlessly
back to the first item.

### Amount of slides

Keep the number of slides within the carousel to a minimum, as it's unlikely users will engage with more than five. The
amount of slides visible at the same time can be specified. Either static or set for each breakpoint individually.
