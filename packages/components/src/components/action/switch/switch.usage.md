# Switch

<TableOfContents></TableOfContents>

## When to use

- If an instant response of applied settings is required without an explicit action.
- To enable or disable a mode, feature, or function. If a setting requires a button press before it can take effect, you
  should use a [Checkbox](components/checkbox) instead.
- When user is toggling independent features or behaviors.

## Types

To ensure a seamless UX in all Porsche web applications it is recommended to use the Switch as follows

| Type                    | Usage                                                                                                                                                                 |
| ----------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Right aligned (default) | If the switch is used stand-alone, we recommend to use the switch aligned to the left (Switch vs. Label).                                                             |
| Left aligned            | If the switch is used within a list (e.g. settings) we recommend to place the switch on the right side (Label vs. Switch). Especially for handling on mobile devices. |

## Behavior

### Label

Remember that Switches are meant to be two mutually exclusive states. The Switch is accompanied by a straightforward and
concise label (always in copytext) to make the component accessible. That microcopy is very important, as users should
be able to see and understand the function behind the Switch. It’s better to avoid anything longer than two words, as
you want that first glance to be all that’s needed to use the Switch.

### Stretching

Depending on the use case (e.g. list on mobile), the spacing between the switch and the label can be stretched to the
size of the container.

### Action

Switches should never require users to press a button to apply the settings because a switch is a toggle button. When
you require users to press a submit button, you confuse them because it’s not what they expect. You should only use
switches on changes that need to take effect instantaneously.

### Validation

We recommend to use only one validation for errors. Success is already provided by the active switch and does not
require any further validation. Use a validation only when necessary. E.g. to show error message or direct feedback of
this control. Do not distract users with unimportant information. For page level feedback, use the
[Banner](components/banner) notification.

### Helper text

Provide help only when help is truly required! For example, if it is important for the user to know what consequences
their activation of the Switch will cause.

### Switch

The switch should change the state only when the server response is positive. For longer delay use the loading state.

## Do's & Don'ts

### Multiple choice

Don’t use the slide Switch for multiple choice questions

### Intermediate state

Don’t use slide Switch when an intermediate state is required. [Use Checkbox instead!](components/checkbox)

### Label

Don’t use only the label to describe the states of the Switch. A label next to the Switch must describe the affected
property.

### Alignment

Preferably set Switches vertically left-aligned, as this supports scannability way better than a horizontal alignment.
