## Types

To ensure a seamless UX in all Porsche web applications it is recommended to use the Tabs Bar as follows

| Type | Usage |
|----|----|
| Standard | Standard (regular) will be used on a monochrome background. |
| Highlight | Highlight (semibold) will be used on a polychrome background (e.g. on images) for better comprehensibility and accessibility. |
| Small | Small are used to provide an additional level or for smaller viewports. | 
| Medium | Medium tabs are usually used in page header or for larger viewports. | 	

## Behavior

### Overflow

When a set of Tabs cannot fit on screen the tab bar becomes horizontal swibeable and navigable with arrows. 
To navigate back and forth use the arrows.

## Usage

### Scalable

As Tabs can horizontally scroll, technically a UI could have as many tabs as needed. You should use no more than six tabs. 

### Text label

It is recommended to always keep the label short. Try not to use more than two words for a tab label.
