# Tabs

Tabs are an intuitive way to organize content and allow navigation between groups of content that are related and at the same level of hierarchy.

## Principles

**Scalable**<br/> As tabs can horizontally scroll, technically a UI could have as many tabs as needed.

**Informative**<br/> Tabs organize content into categories to help users easily find different types of information.

## Styles

Tabs come with two size and two weight modifiers. Each size or weight adjustmets will gradually effect the gap and the thickness of the active border.

### Dark Theme / Images

Dark backgrounds and images will limit the weight options to semibold. We do this due to prevent contrast problems you could run into.

## Overflow

When a set of tabs cannot fit on screen the tab bar becomes horizontal scrollable and navigable with arrows.

- Scrolling horizontally
- Use the arrows to navigate back and forth
- Click on the Tab Item witch then will center the clicked element
- You can jump through tabs via the Tab key
