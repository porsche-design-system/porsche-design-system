# Tags

<TableOfContents></TableOfContents>

## When to use

- Indicate or highlight a certain attribute of an item.
- Show that content is mapped to one or multiple categories.
- Indicate that a certain filter is active.

### Content

Use short text content for easy scanning. Use two words only if necessary to describe the status and differentiate it
from other tags.

### Scalable

Technically a UI could have as many tags as needed, there are different options when a set of tags cannot fit on screen:

- A group of tags becomes horizontal scrollable, swipeable, or navigable with arrows.
- Tags are set in a predefined space and move to the next line once they meet the boundary.

## Types

### Tag

| Name    | Usage                                                                        |
| ------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `p-tag` | To indicate that an item has a certain attribute or is mapped to a category. |

| Variants            |                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Color               | Color themes such as success, neutral, warrning and error can be selected for better visual perception.                                                                                    |
| Icon                | Include icons to improve faster perception.                                                                                                                                                |
| With link or button | To show additional information a link or button can be passed into the tag. By doing this, the entire component becomes clickable and no other content than the button or link is allowed. |

#### With link or button

A link within a tag allows adding certain information such as:

- Further explanation about the tag for better understandability.
- Additional information that is not necessary for the task completion.

Suitable methods to show additional information could be the [Modal](components/modal) component.  
A button or link within a tag is not allowed to be used for navigation.

### Tag Dismissible

| Name                | Usage                                                                                                          |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `p-tag-dismissible` | To show that a certain filter is active. By clicking the tag it is dismissed and the selection is deactivated. |

| Variants |                                                                                                                |
| -------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Label    | If additional information for better orientation is needed. E.G. to which category an attribute/filter refers. |

#### Interaction

On click or tap the entire component should be dismissed for the purpose of deactivating a certain filter. No other
interaction with this component is allowed.

#### Scalable

In case of long label or value dismissible tags can handle multiline text. This is not recommended and should be
avoided.
