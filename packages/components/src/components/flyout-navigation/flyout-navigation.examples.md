<ComponentHeading name="Flyout Navigation"></ComponentHeading>

The `p-flyout-navigation` component is meant for displaying a multi-level navigation structure in a flyout that overlays
the page content from the start side of the screen. It is a controlled component that gives you flexible control over
its behavior.

<Notification heading="Experimental Component" state="warning">
  Interface of Flyout Navigation might change in the near future. In addition, animation/transition concept will change in the future. Currently, only two navigation levels are supported, but we will offer the support of more levels soon.

<Notification heading="Scroll-lock" state="warning">
  This component sets <code>overflow: hidden</code> on the body when opened in order to prevent background scrolling.<br> 
  This doesn't work completely reliable under iOS but is the most stable solution.<br>
  Feel free to address this issue in an Open Source PR, if you can provide a better solution. <b><a href="https://github.com/porsche-design-system/porsche-design-system/blob/main/packages/components/src/utils/setScrollLock.ts">Current implementation</a></b><br>

## Basic

The basic concept of the component is to have a button that opens the `p-navigation-flyout` and a basic 2-level
navigation structure. The **1st level** is generated out of custom `p-flyout-navigation-item` components which generates
a list of toggle buttons to navigate the 2nd level. These items can be filled with slotted anchor links as children
which then represent the **2nd level** of the navigation and are styled automatically by the component.

The most important property of p-flyout is its `open` property. When it is set to `true` the flyout will be visible.

In order to get notified when the `p-navigation-flyout` gets closed by clicking the x button, you need to register an
event listener for the dismiss event which is emitted by `p-navigation-flyout`.

## Active identifier

The `p-navigation-flyout` can be initialized with an `active-identifier` property. This identifier is used to open the
flyout with the corresponding **2nd level** navigation item expanded. The `active-identifier` must match a value of the
`identifier` property of the `p-flyout-navigation-item` component.

### <A11yIcon></A11yIcon> Accessibility hints

Always take care that you expose the current state of the navigation to the user. This can be done by using the
`aria-current="page"` attribute on the corresponding anchor element. And this also causes automatic styling of this
anchor.

## Example with custom content

To give further flexibility, e.g. if you only want to provide a direct link to a page on the **1st level**, you can just
use the `p-link-pure` component. Be aware that you have to adapt the styling of those custom **1st level** items to
match the design of the other 1st level items.

To gain more structure on the **2nd level** we also support out-of-the-box styling of `<h1> to <h6>`, `<p>` and `<a>`
tags. Regarding further individualization of the **2nd level**, you can create your own custom contents and use it as a
child besides the already supported tags.
