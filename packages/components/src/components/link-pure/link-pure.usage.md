# Link Pure

<TableOfContents></TableOfContents>

## Usage

The following segment provides instructions for designers and developers regarding the appropriate utilization of this
component in various situations.

### Do:

- Use a Link Pure as a more subtle call to action compared to the normal Link.
- Use a [Button Pure](components/button-pure) instead of a Link Pure if you want to change a state (e.g. send form)
- Use a Link Pure to navigate the user to another page.
- Use the Icon and Text variant of Link Pure whenever possible as icons should preferably always be paired with text for
  better comprehensibility and accessibility.
- Use the Text only variant when the use of icons causes interference (e.g. in-text placement, no matching icon, complex
  lists or tables, alignment to elements, navigation).
- Use the Text only variant with an underline to ensure intuit "clickability‚Äù.
- Use the Icon only variant only when it's enough to indicate an action with an icon only and the user is fully aware of
  the function due to an expressive and internationally comprehensible icon.
- Use the stretch variant only on small viewports or areas (e.g. mobile views or sidebars).
- Use the default arrow-right-icon in most cases but replace it with another symbol if it is more appropriate.
- Use short and descriptive text labels within a link.

### Don't:

- Don't use Link Pure as the main call to action if you need to draw more attention to the link.
- Don't use Link Pure on images unless it is necessary e.g. when using it as an additional link on image sliders or
  teaser images that are clickable themselves.
- Don't group more than two Links Pure in a row to ensure scannability and legibility.
