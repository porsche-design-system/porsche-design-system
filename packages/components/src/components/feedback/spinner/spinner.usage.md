# Spinner

## When to use

- Use a Spinner when the user has to wait for more than 1 second.
- Use a Spinner either stand-alone or within components (e.g. in Buttons to indicate progress after clicking "save").

## Behavior

### Screen blocking

Using a spinner for only parts of a screen or within dedicated components usually means that the user is able to cancel
the operation, for example by clicking somewhere else. If the user is not supposed to start another activity, you should
block the whole screen. This can be done using a full size block overlay for the whole screen and placing the loader on
top.

## Usage

### Spinner position

Whenever used as an independent item within a page or module, the spinner should always be placed vertically and
horizontally centered within the referring area. Within a dedicated component, the placement of the spinner is
determined by the respective element it replaces or accompanies.

### Component blocking

If a spinner is triggered by an interaction within a component, it is recommended to disable the component while the
spinner is visible.

### With text label

Including text can be helpful to improve clarity. Keep it simple by only explaining **why** the user is waiting. Avoid
using texts such as "Don't click again" to prevent the user from clicking twice on a shopping button in order to not
create an extra order. A loading animation should always be a user-friendly helper, not a threat.

- For small sizes, you should use copytext.
- For larger Spinner sizes, you can use any additional size, depending on your needs and the available space.
- Text must always be placed beneath or on the right side of the loader.

<div style="background:#F2F2F2; width:100%; margin-top: 64px; padding-top: 32px; padding-left: 42px; padding-bottom: 42px;">
    <p-headline variant="headline-3" tag="h3" style="margin-bottom: 24px;">Examples</p-headline>

## Do's & Don'ts

### Spinner overload

Using too much spinners at the same time time or using too much of them within a page or application in general can also
create user frustration. This should be avoided by carefully considering where a loader makes sense and which loader
type is the best.

### Delays of more than 10 seconds

A spinner offers feedback about a loading state, but not on how long it will take for the loading to be finished.
Fostering the user to stare at a spinning wheel for more than 10 seconds will most likely make the users get impatient,
wandering around on your website, abandon their current task, or, worst case, close your application. So if the result
takes more than 10 seconds to appear, you should better provide a progress bar showing the estimated waiting time.
