# Banner Inline
The `p-banner-inline` component provides action-based feedback messages (e.g. after performing a task) or to convey informational and/or critical notification like some site related topics. 
Whenever you want to provide brief, temporary notifications stick to the **Toast component** (work in progress) instead. They are noticeable but do not disrupt the user experience and do not require an action to be taken.
