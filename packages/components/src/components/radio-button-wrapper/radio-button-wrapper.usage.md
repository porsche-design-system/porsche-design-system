## Usage

The following segment provides instructions for designers and developers regarding the appropriate utilization of this
component in various situations.

### Do:

- Use to enable a user to select one value from a predefined list. Use as soon as two options are mutually exclusive.
  Use
- [Checkbox](components/checkbox) instead if there is only one option.
- Use when the user should see all available options.
- Consider using the [Segmented Control](components/segmented-control) for 5 options or fewer.
- Keep the label text short and descriptive (one or two words).
- Select one option by default in a group of radio buttons, except for cases where a pre-selection can lead to wrong
  assumptions.
- Align radio buttons with more than 2 items vertically left-aligned.

### Don't:

- Don't use a radio Button for a large number of items (â‰¥ 7), use the [Select](components/select) or
  [Segmented Control](components/segmented-control) component instead.
