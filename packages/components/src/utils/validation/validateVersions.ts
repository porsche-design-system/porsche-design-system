/**
 * Validates the versions of the Porsche Design System and logs a warning if multiple different versions are detected.
 *
 * This is in particular problematic since multiple versions can initialize at different times.
 * You cannot know when all versions are initialized and versions can be loaded only on particular pages. You have to consider having a mix of versions with the validation logic and without.
 * You would need to detect changes to the document.porscheDesignSystem object and fire a validation on every change.
 * This would be possible with a proxy which is only created once, but it would still only warn about the versions initialized at the time.
 * Also, it makes it difficult to change the implementation in the future since it cannot be overwritten by another proxy.
 * Another approach could be using the stencil 'appload' event (https://stenciljs.com/docs/api), which is already included in older versions of the design system.
 * More information about other implementations can be found in the PR: https://github.com/porsche-design-system/porsche-design-system/pull/2867
